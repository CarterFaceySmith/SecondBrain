# Collaborative Filtering

A rechnique used by recommender systems to recommend items based on other like-minded individuals, i.e by collecting preferences from many uses and assuming similar tastes based on item selection.

## *kNN*-based Collaborative Filtering
Finds the nearest *k* neighbours to user *x* and aggregate their ratings, predict rating on a target item based on these.

You could also do item-item collaborative filtering in a similar way.

All of this is normally validated with [[K-Fold Cross Validation]].

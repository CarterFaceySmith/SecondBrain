An important feature of [[Quantum Mechanics]].

"For certain pairs of attributes of a quantum system, it is impossible to know both with certainty."

These are two different ways that we could choose to encode a bit of information in a qubit. We can do it the normal way, using the $|0>$ and $|1>$ states to encode the bit values `0` and `1` and using the z measurement to read it out. Or we could do it an alternative way, using the $|+>$ and $|->$ states to encode the bit values and the x measurement for read out. 

But the uncertainty principle makes sure that we can't do both at once.

We can define a quantity for the z measurements:
$$<Z> = p_z(0)-p_z(1)$$
Where $p$ represents the probability of the bracketed outcome.

Similarly for x measurements:
$$<Z>^2+<X>^2\leq1$$
This is the uncertainty principle of the [[Qubits]], how much certainty can be shared between these kinds of measurements.

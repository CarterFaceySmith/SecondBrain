# The T Distribution

When a population's [[Standard Deviation]] is unknown (most of the time it's unknown), we use a t distribution to combat against uncertainty of the standard error estimate.

The shape is like a bell curve ([[Normal Distribution]]) but with thicker tails, ie it has a flatter curve with longer tail falloff.

Conceptually the formula is: (observed data - what we expect if the null hypo is true)/average variation

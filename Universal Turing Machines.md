# Universal Turing Machines

A UTM (Universal Turing Machine) is a [[Turing Machines]] that can simulate the operation of some other arbitrary Turing Machine on some arbitrary input.

Remember back to running a Turing Machine with another Turing Machine as input. 

So you first have to figure out some way of *encoding* the initial Turing Machine so it can be read.

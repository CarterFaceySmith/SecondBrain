# RSA

RSA is an [[Encryption]] technique that uses prime numbers.

The user generates a key pair, one public one private, using the asymmetry of prime numbers. The private pair is normally a pair of large primes (p, q), and the public key is their product (p * q), as it is hard to factor backwards without using GCD algorithms.

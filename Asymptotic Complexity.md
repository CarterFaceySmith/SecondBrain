# Asymptotic Complexity

Efficiency is measured in time and space, so best case is an algorithm that uses the least space and time.

Simple time compexity is C(n) where n is the num. of operations in the algorithm (input size).

#### Comparing two or more algorithms based on order of growth

An order of growth is simply a set of functions whose growth is considered equiv., eg 2n, 100n, and n+1 are all in the same order of growth, O(n), linear.

#### When talking about algorithmic complexity/upper bounds

Always contextualise everything in terms of best, avg and worst case, ie this algo has an upper bound (highest growth rate an algo can have) to its growth rate of n^2 in the average case.

Best - resource usage is at best
Avg - resource usage is at average
Worst - resource usage is at worst

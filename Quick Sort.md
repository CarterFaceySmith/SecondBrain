# Quick Sort

A very efficient sorting algorithm based on partitioning of the array into smaller arrays, the overall array is partitioned based on a 'pivot value' where everything above that value is one subarray and everything below is another.

Quick Sort then recursively calls itself again on each resulting array to repeat the process, this algorithm has an average and worst-case time complexity of O(n^2). 

A useful visualisation can be found at the below link.

# Parallelism

## Data parallelism

Distributing subsets of the same data across multiple computing cores and performing *the same* operation on each core.

## Task parallelism

Distributing tasks (threads) across multiple computing cores, with each thread performing a unique operation.

Different threads may operate on the same data, or they can operate on different data.

In [[Statistics]] the standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation of a set of values, where a low standard deviation indicates that the values trend closer to the mean/expected value of the set, whereas a high standard deviation indicates that the values are spread over a wider range.

## Formula
$$\sqrt{\frac{\sum|x-\mu|^2}{N}}$$
- $x$ = some value in the data set
- $\mu$ is the mean of the data set
- $N$ is the number of data points in the population

So basically:
1. Find the mean
2. Find the square of each data points distance to the mean
3. Sum the values
4. Divide by the number of data points
5. Take the square root

Allows for choice, or alternatives in program flow, ie instead of a program having one line of processing it can split or diverge and have multiple conditional (normally) paths it can take. 

Unlike in if-then statements, the method of choice between these altenatives is **not** directly specified by the programmer, the program must decide at run-time between the alternatives via some method applied to all choice points.

As long as there is *at least one path* to a final state, the string is accepted.

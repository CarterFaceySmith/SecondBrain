# Decision Trees

A decision tree is a learning method used for classification, can also be used for regression apparently.

The model predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from data features, for example if we were looking to classify a new datapoint the model could split the graph into quandrants based on where good decision boundaries lie to divide up the pre-existing data, then undergo questioning on the new data (is its y>3, is its x<2 etc etc, whatever reflects the decision boundaries).

# Multiple Linear Regression

One response var (dependent var) is modelled using multiple explanatory vars (independent var) as opposed to just one in [[Linear Regression]].


### Model Selection

- Be wary of overfitting (adding too many independent vars), AKA generalization
- Pick variables that contribute, you want them to correlate to the dependent var but ideally not each other (multicolinearity is the problem here, you shold avoid this)


### [[Data Preparation]]

- Further to the steps in the data prep page:
	- check the relationships between the independent vars using scatterplots etc
		- check [[P-Values]] and correlation, we want the correlation to be low here
	- check the relationships between the independent vars and dependent var standalone using scatterplots etc
		- check the [[P-Values]] and correlation, we want the correlation to be high here


### Multiple Regression

AKA Multi-Variate Regression

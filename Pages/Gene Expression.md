I.e. how genetic information gets read out.

1. The gene proteins (ATCG nucleotides) are transcribed (copied) into precursor [[RNA]];
2. These are then edited, intervals called [[Introns]] are removed and the remains are spliced together to become mature RNA;
3. This then gets translated into proteins.

## Regulatory Elements

Elements that *regulate* the factors of genetic information reading, go figure.
- Position of transcription initiation (what)
- Frequency of transcription (how much)
- Spatio-temporal expression (when and where)

There are thousands of regulatory elements across all steps of gene expression, fan-fucking-tastic.

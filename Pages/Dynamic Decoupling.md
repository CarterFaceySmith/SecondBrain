Used in [[Quantum Circuits]] to decouple a qubit when idle to prevent possible noise generation due to [[Decoherence]], basically the idle qubit is disconnected from the environment and a DD sequence of gates is inserted inplace (matches the identity of the qubit but mitigates decoherence for idle periods).

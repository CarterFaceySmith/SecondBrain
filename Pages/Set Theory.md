# Set Theory

Ya have sets, and ya have subsets of those sets. Simple as. A set is a subset of another set if all elements of it are in that set. The *cardinality* of the set is the number of elements in it, denoted by the number in absolute lines.

Further, if you're a madman, the set of *all* subsets of a set S is called the *poweset* of S and is denoted by:
$$
2^S
$$
A *Cartesian Product* is the ordered sequence of two or more sets, there's a formula for this but the concept is sound.

A *partition* is a collection of n disjoint subsets that satisfies the following:
1. None contain the empty set;
2. The union of subsets equals the entire original set; and
3. The intersection of any two distinct sets is empty.

Operations on sets:
1. Union
2. Intersection
3. Difference
4. Complementation

A set can also be null, this set is called the empty or null set.

If sets have no common element then the sets are disjoint.

A set is finite if the number of elements inside is bounded, otherwise it is infinite.

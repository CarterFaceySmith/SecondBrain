# P-Values and T-Tests

#### What the hell are P-Values?
A measure of the [[Probability]] that an observed deviance from the 'null hypothesis' could have occured by random chance.

Null Hypothesis: the hypothesis that there is no major diff between specified populations and any perceived diff is due to some error

The 'LR' rule is basically that low p-values rejects the null hypothesis, ie if the p-value is low then the observed deviance likely didnt occur by random chance. (Common p-val threshold for this is 0.05)


#### So what's a T-Test?

Conceptually:
	The T-test is testing for the null hypothesis, that's all, so it uses the p-value to do this.


#### How the fuck do you calculate a p-value?
Depends on your data, for high dimensional shit a small p might be better and the inverse might also be true but it wholly depends on the data.

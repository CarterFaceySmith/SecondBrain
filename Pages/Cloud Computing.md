>"Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. This cloud model is composed of five essential characteristics, three service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), and four deployment models (private, community, public, hybrid)."

I.e. A way of easily sharing and using a large pool of computing resources with minimal direct management.

## Essential Characteristics
- On-demand self-service
- Broad network access
- Resource pooling
- Rapid elasticity
- Measured service

## Types of Cloud Service Models
1. [[IaaS (Infrastrucure as a Service)]]
2. [[PaaS (Platform as a Service)]]
3. [[SaaS (Software as a Service)]]

## Types of Cloud Deployment Models
1. Public Cloud: IT resources provisioned over the internet via web applications or services from a remote third-party provider
2. Community Cloud: A group of organisations share a cloud of resources on top of a public cloud
3. Private Cloud: Exclusive resources via private networks for one client
4. Hybrid of any of the above

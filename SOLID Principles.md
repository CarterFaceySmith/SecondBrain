SOLID is an acronym for a set of five principles that help in designing software systems that are easy to maintain and extend over time.

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

A class should have only one reason to change. This principle is about actors and high-level architecture.

## Open-Closed Principle (OCP)

Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification. This principle is about handling new changes or functionality.

## Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types. This principle is about subtyping and inheritance.

## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. This principle deals with the disadvantages of fat interfaces.

## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions. This principle is about decoupling.

## About The Project

This is my combined vault of knowledge on several varied concepts and subjects going back as far as 2021 or so.

These notes got me through a Bachelor of Computer Science, and many other equally straining situations.

The main topics covered include:
- Generic programming concepts
- C and C++
- Mathematics
- Investing and financial products
- Machine Learning/AI
- Neuroscience
- React Native
- Qt/QML
- Quantum Computing

Most notes are written conceptually, with a casual and stream-of-consciousness style of writing to deformalise concepts and assist with quick high-level understanding of complex subjects. Others are written in a simple point-to-point style.

As learning is a constant process, so to is the expansion of this knowledge base, I intend to open source these for the remainder of my life in the hopes that they assist others in the same way they have assisted me.

*Please be aware that notes on more complex topics may include swearing.*

## Getting Started

To get started, you can clone the entire repository or pick files as required.

### Git

Run:  `git clone https://github.com/CarterFaceySmith/SecondBrain.git`

### [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)

Obsidian is a Markdown based knowledge base application, it revolves around the idea that "the human brain is non-linear", notes are designed to follow a concept-based approach where things are simplified as much as possible via either black-boxing of unnecessary complexity or linking to deeper level concepts.

I personally use this application for notetaking and organisation because I enjoy the features and keybindings but you can effectively use whatever allows for Markdown importing.

#### Obsidian Installation

1. Download the latest Obsidian release for your operating system [here](https://obsidian.md/).
2. Clone the repository as above: `git clone https://github.com/CarterFaceySmith/SecondBrain.git`
3. Open the cloned repository as a "Vault" from the Obsidian startup menu.

Simple.

### Prerequisites

None, the files are all Markdown so use whatever you please to view them, you can even just navigate through this repository if you wish.

### Notes:

If you find any errors, issues or something of note for a different reason please feel free to either log an issue or [contact me](mailto:carterfaceysmith@gmail.com).

<h3 align="center">Second Brain</h3>

<p align="center">Compiled notes on various concepts.</p>

## About The Project

This is my combined vault of knowledge on several varied concepts and subejcts going back as far as 2021 or so.

The main topics covered include:
- General Programming
- Mathematics
- Genetics
- Machine Learning
- Quantum Computing

The notes themselves are written conceptually, with a mainly casual and stream-of-consciousness style of writing to deformalise concepts and assist with quick high-level understanding of complex subjects.

As learning is a constant process, so to is the expansion of this knowledge base, I intend to opensource these for the remainder of my life in the hopes that they assist others in the same way they have assisted me.

Please be aware that notes on more complex topics may include swearing.

## Getting Started

To get started, you can clone the entire repository or pick files as required.

### Git

Run:  `git clone https://github.com/CarterFaceySmith/SecondBrain.git`

### [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)

Obsidian is a Markdown based knowledge base application based on the idea that "the human brain is non-linear", notes are designed to follow a concept-based approach where things are simplified as much as possible via either black-boxing of unnecessary complexity or linking to deeper level concepts.

I personally use this application for notetaking and organisation because I enjoy the features and keybindings but you can effectively use whatever allows for Markdown importing.

#### Obsidian Installation

1. Download the latest Obsidian release for your operating system [here](https://obsidian.md/).
2. Clone the repository as above: `git clone https://github.com/CarterFaceySmith/SecondBrain.git`
3. Open the cloned repository as a "Vault" from the Obsidian startup menu.

Simple.

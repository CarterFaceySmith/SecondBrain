The Sharpe Ratio is a [[Finance]] formula that describes how much excess return you receive for the extra [[Volatility]] you endure holding a riskier [[Asset]], basically: "how much am I going to be rewarded for putting up this with volatility?".

$$\frac{rx-rf}{StdDev(x)}$$

## TLDR
The higher the Sharpe Ratio, then theoretically the better the investment is from a risk/return perspective.

## Further Defined

### Return ($rx$)
- Returns can be measured on any time frequency/scale if normally distributed
- Note that unfortunately not all asset returns are normally distributed ([[Normal Distribution]])
- It can be dangerous to use this formula when returns are not normally distributed.

### Risk-Free Rate of Return ($rf$)
-  Used to see if you are being properly compensateed for the risk assumed with your asset of choice
- Traditionally the shortest-dated government bond is used as the stand-in for this

### [[Standard Deviation]] ($StdDev(x)$)
- AKA. total risk measurement
- Rarely calculated by hand these days

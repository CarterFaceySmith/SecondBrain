A field of mathematics concerned primarily with, you guessed it, defining the *relations* between things! Wow. Naturally this makes it strongly related to [[Functions and Relations]], alongside [[Cardinality]].

A relation is commonly defined as $xRy$, meaning '$x$ has a relation to $y$', or alternatively a struckthrough R for not related.

Note: **A relation is a set**, so brush up on [[Set Theory]], the above can be redefined as $(x,y)\in R$ .

Remember that a graph node picture can define a set potentially easier, with related points having arrows between them.

## Combining Relations with [[Propositional Logic]]
Since relational expressions always have a true or false value, they can be combined with logical operators to create hideous frankensteins.

$xRy \Rightarrow yRx$ is a statement whose truth or falsity depends on the values of $x$ and $y$, and it can be translated to 'If x has a relation to y then y has a relation to x', noting the arrow is the 'if-then' symbol more or less.

A *function* is a rule that assigns to elements of one set a unique element of another set, ie we have two sets and here's some fucked rule that sends elems from the second set to the first.

$$
f: S_1â†’S_2
$$

When *f* in the above is a function, then the first set is the *domain* of *f* and the second set is its *range*. When the domain is all of $S_1$ then the function is deemed 'total' by the maths gods, else it falls to the wayside and is deemed 'partial', what a tragedy.

# Interpolation Search

An improved version of [[Binary Search]], it works by probing the position of the required value, but the data structure must be sorted and evenly distributed. You need to know position in advance.

Otherwise works the same as [[Binary Search]].

Run-time complexity of O(log(log n)) in favourable situations.

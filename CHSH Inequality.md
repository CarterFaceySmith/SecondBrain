An inequality [[Proofs]] used to prove [[Bell's Theorem]], asserts that local hidden variable theories can't account for some consequences of [[Entanglement]] in [[Quantum Mechanics]].

## The Theory
For this experiment, we will create an entangled pair on which we measure each qubit on two different bases. We will label the bases for the first qubit 𝐴 and 𝑎 and the bases for the second qubit 𝐵 and 𝑏. This allows us to compute the CHSH quantities 𝑆1 and 𝑆2
$$𝑆1=𝐴(𝐵−𝑏)+𝑎(𝐵+𝑏)$$
Each observable is either +1 or −1. Clearly, one of the terms 𝐵±𝑏 must be 0, and the other must be ±2. Therefore, 𝑆1=±2. 

The average value of 𝑆1 must satisfy the inequality:
$$|⟨𝑆1⟩|=|⟨𝐴𝐵⟩−⟨𝐴𝑏⟩+⟨𝑎𝐵⟩+⟨𝑎𝑏⟩|≤2$$
As the same way, 𝑆2 and its inequality are defined as the below.
$$𝑆2=𝐴(𝐵+𝑏)−𝑎(𝐵−𝑏)$$
$$|⟨𝑆2⟩|=|⟨𝐴𝐵⟩+⟨𝐴𝑏⟩−⟨𝑎𝐵⟩+⟨𝑎𝑏⟩|≤2$$

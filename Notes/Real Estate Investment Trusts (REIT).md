## Introduction to REITs

Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) are regulated investment vehicles that provide exposure to real estate assets through publicly traded securities. These entities must distribute a significant portion of their taxable income (typically 90%) to shareholders in the form of dividends.

### Structural Requirements

1. **Income Distribution**
   - Minimum 90% of taxable income as dividends
   - Results in minimal corporate taxation
   - Creates high-yield investment characteristics

2. **Asset Composition**
   - Minimum 75% of assets must be real estate
   - 75% of gross income must come from:
     * Property rents
     * Interest on mortgages
     * Real estate sales

3. **Shareholder Structure**
   - Minimum 100 shareholders
   - No more than 50% held by five or fewer individuals

## Portfolio Analysis Framework

### 1. Property Portfolio Assessment

#### Quality Metrics
- Location characteristics
  * Demographics
  * Economic indicators
  * Infrastructure access
  * Market vacancy rates
- Physical attributes
  * Age of properties
  * Maintenance requirements
  * Energy efficiency
  * Structural integrity

#### Portfolio Composition
- Property type distribution
- Geographic diversification
- Age distribution
- Development pipeline
- Acquisition/disposal strategy

### 2. Tenant Analysis

#### Lease Structures
1. **Triple Net Lease (NNN)**
   - Tenant responsible for:
     * Property taxes
     * Insurance
     * Maintenance
   - Provides most predictable income stream

2. **Double Net Lease (NN)**
   - Landlord typically responsible for:
     * Structural maintenance
     * Building insurance
   - Tenant covers remaining costs

3. **Gross Lease**
   - Landlord bears all operating expenses
   - Higher rental income but more variable expenses
   - Common in multi-tenant office buildings

#### Tenant Quality Assessment
- Credit ratings of major tenants
- Industry sector exposure
- Lease expiry profile
- Tenant concentration risk
- Historical default rates

## Financial Analysis

### 1. Key Financial Metrics

#### Balance Sheet Metrics
```
Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Debt / Shareholders' Equity
Interest Coverage Ratio = EBIT / Interest Expense
```

#### Operating Metrics
```
Occupancy Rate = Occupied Space / Total Leasable Space
Average Lease Term = Weighted Average Lease Expiry (WALE)
```

### 2. Income Analysis

#### Revenue Components
- Base rental income
- Percentage rent (retail properties)
- Service charge recovery
- Other operating income

#### Expense Structure
- Property operating expenses
- Management fees
- Financing costs
- Maintenance capital expenditure

## Valuation Methodologies

### 1. Earnings-Based Metrics

#### Funds From Operations (FFO)
```
FFO = Net Income 
    + Depreciation & Amortization
    - Gains from Property Sales
    + Losses from Property Sales
```

#### Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO)
```
AFFO = FFO
     - Normalized Recurring Capital Expenditure
     - Straight-line Rent Adjustments
     + Stock-based Compensation
```

#### Price Multiples
```
P/FFO = Share Price / FFO per Share
P/AFFO = Share Price / AFFO per Share
```

### 2. Asset-Based Valuation

#### Net Asset Value (NAV)
```
NAV = Market Value of Assets - Total Liabilities
NAV per Share = NAV / Shares Outstanding
```

#### Capitalisation Rate Analysis
```
Property Cap Rate = Net Operating Income / Property Value
Portfolio Cap Rate = Total NOI / Total Portfolio Value
```

### 3. Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

#### Dividend Discount Model
```
Fair Value = D₀(1 + g) / (r - g)
Where:
D₀ = Current dividend
g = Growth rate
r = Required return
```

## Growth Strategies

## Accounting Considerations

### GAAP vs IFRS Treatment

#### US GAAP

## Quantitative Examples

### Example 1: A-REIT Valuation Using Multiple Approaches

Let's value a hypothetical A-REIT using different methods:

**Company Profile: RetailCo REIT**
```
Current Share Price: $10.00
Annual Dividend: $0.50
FFO per Share: $0.65
AFFO per Share: $0.60
Net Operating Income: $100M
Portfolio Value: $1.2B
Total Debt: $400M
Shares Outstanding: 100M
```

#### 1. Price/FFO Analysis
```
P/FFO = $10.00 / $0.65 = 15.4x
Sector Average P/FFO = 16.5x
Implied Fair Value = $0.65 × 16.5 = $10.73
```

#### 2. Capitalisation Rate
```
Portfolio Cap Rate = $100M / $1.2B = 8.33%
Sector Average Cap Rate = 8%
Implied Portfolio Value at Sector Cap Rate = $100M / 0.08 = $1.25B
```

#### 3. NAV Calculation
```
Assets:
Portfolio Value: $1.2B
Other Assets: $50M
Total Assets: $1.25B

Liabilities:
Total Debt: $400M
Other Liabilities: $50M
Total Liabilities: $450M

NAV = $1.25B - $450M = $800M
NAV per Share = $800M / 100M = $8.00
```

### Example 2: Distribution Analysis
```
Annual Distribution: $0.50 per share
Components:
- Rental Income: $0.35 (70%)
- Tax-deferred: $0.10 (20%)
- Capital Gains: $0.05 (10%)

Distribution Yield = $0.50 / $10.00 = 5%
```

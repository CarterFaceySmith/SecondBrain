Two methods can be used to measure [[Brain]] activity by way of inference from monitoring hemodynamic (deoxy- and oxy-[[Haemoglobin]] changes in the [[Cerebral Cortex (Outer Brain Sheet)]]);
- [[Functional Near-infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS)]] 
- [[Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)]]

Temporal resolution of both is limited by that fact that the hemodynamic response itself is slow relative to the electrical response of [[Neuron]]s.

Spatial resolution is high for [[Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)]] but low for [[Functional Near-infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS)]], although the former is more expensive and cumbersome than the later.

>"*At present, fMRI is likely to be most useful as a noninvasive method for localizing (and possibly training) brain function prior to implantation of microarrays or other invasive BCI devices, whereas fNIRS may serve in simple BCI systems that provide basic communication and that are practical for long-term home use by people with severe disabilities.*" - Wolpaw

# Probability

### Types of Probability
- Marginal: probability of occurence of a single event
- Joint: probability of two events happening at the same time
- Conditional: probability depending on something that has already happened, ie the occurence of a previous event or outcome

### Types of events
- Joint: can have common outcomes, ie can happen together (e.g. good grades and good at sports)
- Disjoint: cannot have common outcomes, ie cannot happen together (eg. life and death)

### Terminology
- Random experiment: an experiment/process of which the outcome cannot be entirely predicted
- Sample space (S): the entire possible set of outcomes of a random experiment
- Event: one or more outcomes of an experiment, a subset (remember set theory) of the sample space (S)

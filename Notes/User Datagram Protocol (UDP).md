**Definition:** UDP is a connectionless, unreliable, and lightweight communication protocol used for transmitting datagrams (packets) over a network.

**Characteristics:**
    - **Connectionless:** UDP does not establish a connection before data transmission. Each UDP packet is treated independently, allowing for low-latency communication.
    - **Unreliable:** UDP does not guarantee delivery, ordering, or duplication prevention of packets. It provides a best-effort delivery mechanism without acknowledgment or retransmission.
    - **Low Overhead:** UDP has minimal protocol overhead, making it suitable for applications where speed and efficiency are prioritised over reliability.

**Usage:** UDP is commonly used in real-time applications where immediate delivery of data is more critical than reliability, such as online gaming, streaming media (e.g., video and audio), VoIP (Voice over IP), and DNS (Domain Name System).

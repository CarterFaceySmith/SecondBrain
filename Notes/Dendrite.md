### Key Features:

1. **Structure**:
    - Tree-like branching structures
    - Extend from the cell body
    - Covered in dendritic spines (small protrusions)
2. **Dendritic Spines**:
    - Small membranous protrusions
    - Primary site of excitatory synapses
    - Can change shape and size (synaptic plasticity)
3. **Passive Properties**:
    - Dendrites can passively conduct electrical signals
    - Signal strength decreases with distance (electrotonic decay)
4. **Active Properties**:
    - Some dendrites have voltage-gated ion channels
    - Can generate local dendritic spikes
5. **Integration**:
    - Summation of multiple synaptic inputs
    - Temporal summation: inputs close in time
    - Spatial summation: inputs close in space
6. **Dendritic Computation**:
    - Complex processing of synaptic inputs
    - Can perform logical operations (AND, OR, NOT)

**Computing Analogy**: Dendrites are like a sophisticated input/output (I/O) system on a computer:

- The dendritic tree is like a complex network of input ports, each branch collecting signals from different sources.
- Dendritic spines are like specialised adaptors, each optimised for a particular type of input signal.
- Passive properties are like simple wire connections, while active properties are like powered USB ports that can modify the incoming signal.
- Integration is like a signal processing unit, combining multiple inputs into a single output.
- Dendritic computation is akin to edge computing, where some processing occurs at the input level before reaching the main CPU (the cell body).

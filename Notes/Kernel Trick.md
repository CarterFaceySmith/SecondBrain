# Kernel Trick

A 'trick' that can turn non-linear decision surface data into linear decision surface data for the purposes of an [[SVM (Support Vector Machines)]], it does this by transforming the data from its current dimensionality to a higher dimensionality where it may be linearly seperable.

Passing a kernel argument into an SVM func tells the SVM what sort of decision surface to give, eg linear, poly, etc.

Critical factors to signal attenuation and stability are found predominantly in the chosen design of the electrode you are using and its purpose.

## Key Overview

- In order to reduce large offset potentials all electrodes connected to the same amplifier should use the same material.
- EEG electrodes can be passive or active.
	- Passive
		- Metal disks made of tin, silver, silver chloride or gold-plated silver connected to an amplifier by a cable
		- Cleaning or lightly abrading the skin and using conducting gels at the interface between scalp and electrode is critical to allow [[Current]] to pass from the scalp to the sensor and along the cable to the amplifier
		- [[Brain]] signals susceptible to contamination via movement and environmental electromagnetic factors, therefore important to shield, shorten and stabilise the cable as much as possible
		- Inexpensive, majority use case
	- Active
		-

## Core Concept
Degrowth represents both an academic theory and social movement that challenges the fundamental premise of [[Gross Domestic Product (GDP)]] growth as a measure of human and economic development. The theory emerges from the intersection of economic anthropology, ecological economics, environmental sciences, and development studies.

## Key Arguments

### 1. Fundamental Premises
- Economic infinity cannot exist within finite planetary resources
- GDP should be abandoned as a primary policy objective
- Focus should shift to metrics like:
  * Life expectancy
  * Health outcomes
  * Educational attainment
  * Housing accessibility
  * Ecological sustainability

### 2. Critique of Current Systems
- Challenges free market [[Capitalism]]
- Questions the viability of "[[Green Capitalism]]"
- Critiques the sustainable development goals (SDG) model
- Highlights limitations of market-based solutions to environmental collapse

## Scientific Basis

### Resource Constraints
1. **Ecological Footprint**
   - High-income countries use ~6.4 global hectares per person
   - Low-income countries use ~1 global hectare per person
   - Current global consumption exceeds Earth's capacity

2. **Decoupling Limitations**
   - Questions possibility of absolute decoupling (GDP growth without increased resource use)
   - Evidence suggests decoupling occurs only:
     * Temporarily
     * Locally
     * At insufficient rates to prevent climate crisis

### Environmental Considerations
- Links to peak oil concerns
- Addresses ecosystem destabilisation
- Considers [[Holocene]] Extinction
- Examines [[Anthropocene]] impacts

## Critical Research Findings

A 2024 review revealed significant limitations in degrowth studies:
- 90% were opinion-based rather than analytical
- Few utilised quantitative/qualitative data
- Limited formal modelling
- Lack of rigorous policy evaluation

## Alternative Proposals

### Economic Restructuring
1. **Public Services**
   - Emphasis on extensive public service provision
   - Focus on care work
   - Promotion of self-organisation
   - Development of commons

2. **Resource Reallocation**
   - Shift from non-renewable to renewable resources
   - Focus on human capabilities
   - Emphasis on local production and consumption

### Social Transformation
- Movement from economic materialism to participatory culture
- Promotion of communal environmental stewardship
- Challenge to high-consumption lifestyles
- Addressing historical North-South inequities

## Implementation Challenges

### Political Feasibility
- Often viewed as politically unpalatable
- Faces resistance from established economic interests
- Challenges with democratic voluntarism

### Technical Limitations
- "Rebound effect" (Jevons paradox) complications
- Technology's role in matter-energy throughput
- Implementation scale considerations

## Future Implications

### Climate Change Mitigation
- Degrowth scenarios often neglected in IPCC considerations
- Potential for minimizing key feasibility risks
- Challenge of implementing structural changes

### Sustainable Development
- Questions conventional sustainable development models
- Promotes complete abandonment of growth-based economics
- Advocates for localized, self-sufficient economies

## Current Relevance

The theory gains significance as:
1. SDG progress stalls (50%) or reverses (30%)
2. Evidence questions absolute decoupling possibility
3. Climate crisis demands radical solutions
4. Resource depletion accelerates

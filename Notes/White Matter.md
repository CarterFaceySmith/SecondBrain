Bundles of [[Axon]]s connecting parts of the [[Brain]]s [[Grey Matter]] (i.e. neurons), the wiring of the brain.

*45% of the human brain is just white matter.*

This is relevant because one cannot hope to understand the [[Cerebral Cortex (Outer Brain Sheet)]] without knowing how its regions are connected. The specific connections of each region may serve as a fingerprint of that region across species, enabling the discovery of similarities between species (homologies).

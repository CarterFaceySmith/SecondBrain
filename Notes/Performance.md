[[Training]] is only training, during training for any skill you acquire the neural pathway reinforcement required to perform that task in a low-pressure/[[Stress]] environment.

The thing that can't be gained from training is the ability to perform that skill in a high-pressure environment, for example when a competently trained pianist displays poor performance at a recital, it often isn't that they have not practised to an adequate degree, but simply that the environment is hindering their output ability.

Every extraneous variable in your environment and the lead-up to it will have some effect on output, the key to overcoming this is being able to go with the [[Flow]] and improvise with what occurs, alongside forging the mind's ability to handle stress generally.

Firstly we must define exactly what is studied in [[Cognitive Neuroscience]], the [[Mind]]. From a CN standpoint the mind is *"a set of computations that extract representations (= percepts/thoughts)"*.

## Marr's Levels of Analysis (applied to colour vision)

1. Computational theory
	1. What info is extracted and why?
		1. R, useful for characterising objects
	2. What cues are available?
		1. Only L
	3. Is the inference ill-posed/underdeterminate?
		1. Yes, I is unknown
	4. What regularities in the world constrain the inference?
		1. What other sources of info might constrain I?
2. Algorithm/Representation
	1. How does the system do what it does, can we write code to do this?
	2. What assumptions, computations representations are required?
	3. How would we find out?
		1. [[Psychophysics]]
3. Hardware representation
	1. How is the system physically realised in neurons and brains

You need many levels of analysis to understand a problem like this, and therefore a lot of methods.

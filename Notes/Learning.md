## On Memorisation

Spaced repetition software like Anki or Mochi is crucial for myself personally to develop an entrenched level of memory for some small concept like syntax or foreign language vocabulary.

Again, this is an area of learning where small daily consistency shines over massive swing efforts.

To memorise larger concepts, they need to be broken down into their compartmentalised chunks, ideally as isolated ideas or concepts themselves, which are then linked together to form a cohesive whole.

## Notes from The Art of Learning

- When learning, it is important to maintain high curiosity and stay on the steep end of the learning curve, stretching yourself is where the progress is generally amplified.
	- Further, it is important to fail somewhat often, otherwise it is likely a sign you are too comfortable and perhaps not aiming high enough to push yourself.

- In order to learn something hard, the adversity must be faced head on, when beaten by this adversity it is important to reflect and learn whatever lesson it is teaching you that resulted in failure.
	- This can be encountered more by pursuing harder and harder things.

- When faced with failure or a mistake it it important to maintain a clear head and analyse it instead of getting swept up in emotional distress.

- Mastery of the fundamentals is more important than some esoteric technique.

- Emotions can be used to fuel your game, whatever that is, it is important to recognise which is suitable for some set of circumstances for you.

- Take breaks, the brain needs to reflect and digest.

- A mentality of almost naive belief is required to reach a high level in something you may struggle at, consistency will bear the most fruit as long as one doesn't give up.

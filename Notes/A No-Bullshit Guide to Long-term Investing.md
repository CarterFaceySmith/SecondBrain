# Building Real Wealth

## Defining Real Wealth - Beyond Just Numbers

- Financial independence: covering all basic needs without active income
- Freedom to make choices without immediate financial pressure
- Ability to weather economic storms
- Capacity to help others and create impact

### Practical Wealth Metrics

1. **The 4% Rule**
   - Your investments should generate 4% of your annual needs
   - Example: Need $80k/year = $2M investment portfolio
   
2. **Multiple Income Streams**
   - Investment returns
   - Passive income
   - Active income
   - Real estate returns

## Fundamental Principle: Control Your Fucking Spending

- **Track Everything**
  * Review spending monthly
  * Set realistic budgets

- **The 50/30/20 Rule**
  * 50% needs
  * 30% wants
  * 20% savings/investments
  * Or tailor to you if you want to go harder or lighter, but lighter is not recommended

- **Lifestyle Creep Prevention**
  * Maintain living standards even as income grows
  * Bank raises and bonuses
  * Question every subscription

## Secondary Principle: Strategic Diversification

My personal take, not financial advice but merely a practical example.
#### ETF Portfolio (75% of Investment Capital)

```
Core Holdings:
- NYSE:VOO (S&P 500 Index) - 25%
  * Low fees (0.03%)
  * Broad market exposure
  * Historical returns ~10% annually

- NYSE:VOOG (S&P 500 Growth) - 15%
  * Growth-focused companies
  * Higher potential returns
  * Higher volatility

- ASX:VAS (Australian Market) - 15%
  * Local market exposure
  * Dividend advantages
  * Currency diversification

Sector Specific:
- ITA (Aerospace & Defense) - 10%
  * Defense sector exposure
  * Government contract stability
  * Long-term growth potential
  * Global instability play

- BATS:NLR (Nuclear & Uranium) - 5%
  * Clean energy exposure
  * Limited correlation with broader market
  * General computing resource growth prediction
  * Long-term energy transition play

- NasdaqGM:DTCR (Data Centers) - 5%
  * Digital infrastructure
  * Cloud computing growth
  * General computing resource growth prediction
  * Tech sector exposure
```

#### Cryptocurrency (10% of Investment Capital)

```
- Bitcoin (BTC) - 7%
  * Store of value
  * Market leader
  * Institutional adoption
  * High risk, high reward volatility hold

- Solana (SOL) - 3%
  * High performance blockchain
  * DeFi ecosystem
  * Growth potential
  * High risk, high reward volatility hold
```

I don't include real estate in the percentage calculation of investment capital currently.

### [[Real Estate]] Integration

#### Investment Properties
- **Benefits**
  * Rental income
  * Tax advantages
  * Leverage potential
	  * Hard to find other investments where you can whack 20% down and get a foot in the door at 5x leverage (depending on your credit rating etc.)
  * Inflation hedge (*maybe*)

- **Consideration Factors**
  * Location growth potential
  * Infrastructure connectivity (i.e. public transport, parks, schools, etc.)
  * Rental yield vs capital growth
  * Maintenance costs
  * Interest rates

#### [[Real Estate Investment Trusts (REIT)]] as an Alternative
- Liquid exposure to real estate
- Professional management
- Diversified property portfolio
- Lower capital requirement
- Low personal maintenance

## Strategic Approach

### 1. Focus on Your Circle of Competence
- **Identify Your Strengths**
  * Professional knowledge
  * Industry expertise
  * Technical skills

- **Expand Thoughtfully**
  * Read extensively
  * Take courses, if you want to dive deeper
  * Network with experts, if you care that much and want to min-max I guess
  * Start small and scale

### 2. Time Horizon Reality

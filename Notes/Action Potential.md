A brief (1 msec) fluctuation in [[Neuron]]al membrane potential that occurs when excitatory synaptic input to the neuron triggers an opening of channels in the cell membrane for specific [[Ion]]s to flow through.

These action potential are then regenerated as they travel down a neurons [[Axon]] to provide input to other neurons like a tree flow structure.

The basic unit of interneuron communication.

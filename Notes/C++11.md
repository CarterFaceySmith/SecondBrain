The [[C++]]11 standard, also known as C++0x, was officially released in September 2011. It introduced several new language features and improvements, including:

- **[[C++ auto]]**: Allows compiler to infer the variable type based on its initializing expression.

    ```
    auto integer = 42; // integer is of int type
    auto floating = 3.14; // floating is of double type
    ```

- **Range-Based for Loop**: Provides foreach-like semantics for iterating through a container or [[Arrays]].

    ```
    std::vector<int> numbers {1, 2, 3, 4};
    for (int number : numbers) {
        std::cout << number << std::endl;
    }
    ```

- **[[C++ Lambdas (Closures)]]**: Anonymous functions that allow the creation of function objects more easily.

    ```
    auto add = [](int a, int b) -> int { return a + b; };
    int sum = add(42, 13); // sum is equal to 55
    ```

- **nullptr**: A new keyword to represent null [[Pointer]], more type-safe than using a literal ‘0’ or “NULL”.

    ```
    int *ptr = nullptr;
    ```

- **[[Threads]] Support Library**: Provides a standard way to work with threads and synchronize data access across threads.

    ```
    std::thread t([]() { std::cout << "Hello from another thread\n"; });
    t.join();
    ```

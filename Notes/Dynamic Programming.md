An approach to solving data structure and [[Algorithms]] based problems.

The problem is typically broken down into smaller subproblems which, unlike in a divide-and-conquer approach, are not solved independently but rely on and solve each other.

Normally focus on *overall* solution optimisation instead of local optimisation like a [[Greedy Technique & Algorithms]].

#### Typical problems:
- Fibonacci number series
- Knapsack
- Tower of Hanoi
- Shortest Path (Dijkstra)
- Project Scheduling

## Overview

The key considerations include:
1. Safety
2. Neural signals acquired must have sufficient information to support [[Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)]] use
3. Reliability
4. Degree of invasiveness must not exceed what is absolutely necessary

Primary components:
- The array of electrode sites
- The lead (or trace)
- The dielectric
- The substrate
- Optional surface coatings

## How Does a [[Microelectrode]] Register [[Brain]] Signals?

### Signal Generation and Collection

- Biopotentials at electrode surfaces come from nearby neural signals (action potentials and synaptic potentials)
- Brain tissue acts as a volume conductor, allowing signals to travel from [[Neuron]]s to the electrode
- Multiple neural sources combine to create an electric field that the electrode samples

### Signal Characteristics

- Extracellular action potentials:
    - Amplitude: 50-500 microvolts
    - Bandwidth: 500-5000 Hz
- Local field potentials:
    - Amplitude: 10-800 microvolts
    - Bandwidth: 0.1-200 Hz

### Signal Transduction Process

The electrode converts biological signals to electronic current through two main mechanisms:

1. Capacitive displacement current (from electrode-tissue interface capacitance)
2. Chemical current (from oxidation-reduction reactions at the electrode surface)

### Key Components

The recording system consists of three main functional elements:

1. Biopotential sensing - combines neural signals based on source amplitude and distance
2. Neural interface tissue impedance - represents local tissue conductivity
3. Electrode-tissue interface - handles electrochemical and electrical signal conversion

### Noise Sources

Several factors can affect signal quality:

- Internal neural noise (from distant or unrelated neural activity)
- External biological noise (from muscle activity, eye movements, heartbeats)
- Electrode noise (from thermal activity and electrochemical processes)
- Tissue response over time (can affect local conductivity)

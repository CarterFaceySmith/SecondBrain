Measured at three scales:
1. Micro
2. Meso
3. Macro

Sources of [[Current]] in the [[Cerebral Cortex (Outer Brain Sheet)]] can generate [[Action Potential]]s ([[Brain]] signals) at all three scales.

Small and intermediate scales provided by LFPs and ECoG provide more local detail but sparse spatial resolution.

High resolution [[Electroencephalography (EEG)]] provided by way of Laplacian (?) or dura image (?) [[Algorithms]] gives good spatial resolution at the cost of eliminating large-scale dynamics that may be of interest.

Observed or recorded dynamic behaviours are modelled using the weighted linear sums (i.e., linear superposition) of the underlying sources.

>"*Different brain regions and measurement scales may exhibit quite different dynamics (e.g., dominant frequencies), but such differences are due only to the different weights in the sums associated with different source locations and recording methods*" - Wolpaw

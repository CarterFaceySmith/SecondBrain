The [[C++]]14 standard was officially released in December 2014 as a small extension over [[C++11]], focusing more on fine-tuning language features and fixing issues. Some of the new features introduced:

- **Generic [[C++ Lambdas (Closures)]]: Allows lambda function parameters to be declared with ‘[[C++ auto]]’ type placeholders.

    ```cpp
    auto add = [](auto a, auto b) { return a + b; };
    auto sum_i = add(42, 13); // Still works with integers
    auto sum_f = add(3.14, 2.72); // Now works with doubles too
    ```

- **Binary Literals**: Allow you to input integers as binary literals for better readability.

    ```cpp
    int b = 0b110101; // Decimal value is 53
    ```

- **decltype(auto)**: Deduces the type of variable to match that of the expression it is initialised with.

    ```cpp
    auto func = [](auto a, auto b) { return a * b; };
    decltype(auto) result = func(5, 3.14); // decltype(auto) deduces to "double"
    ```

- **Variable Templates**: Allows you to define variables with template parameters.

    ```cpp
    template <typename T>
    constexpr T pi = T(3.1415926535897932385);
    float r = pi<float>; // Instantiated as a float
    double d = pi<double>; // Instantiated as a double
    ```

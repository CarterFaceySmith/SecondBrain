See [[Power Law]].

Given some relation $f(x)-ax^{-k}$, scaling the argument $x$ by some constant factor $c$ causes only a proportionate scaling of the function itself.

All [[Power Law]]s with a particular scaling component are equivalent up to constant factors, since each is simply a scaled version of the others.

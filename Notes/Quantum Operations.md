Basically, each starting and end state of the qubits has a transition amplitude, have a look at the [[Probability Amplitudes]] page for more on that shit. We can describe any quantum operation through these transition amplitudes, noting that for an *n* qubit state vector we can have a maximum of $2^n$ amplitudes and therefore $(2^n)^2$ transition amplitudes.

## Rules, play fair, come on now
Just like not every vector is a valid state vector (see [[Probability Amplitudes]]), not all matrices are valid quantum operations, it must keep the total probability of the output states equal to 1.

Axios is a popular JavaScript library used for making [[HTTP]] requests. Itâ€™s promise-based, which means it leverages [[JavaScript]]'s promise syntax for handling [[Asynchronous Programming]] operations. This makes it easy to use `.then()` for handling successful responses and `.catch()` for dealing with errors.

- **Request and Response Handling**: Supports various HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and handles JSON data seamlessly.
- **Interceptors**: Allows you to define functions that intercept requests or responses before they are handled by `then` or `catch`. This is useful for tasks like adding authentication tokens or logging.
- **Automatic Transformation**: Automatically transforms request and response data to [[JSON]], which simplifies working with APIs.
- **Error Handling**: Provides a clear structure for catching and managing errors.

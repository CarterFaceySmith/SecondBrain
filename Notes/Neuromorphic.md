"Neuromorphic" literally means "brain-like in form." It refers to artificial systems that mimic the structure and function of [[Biological Neural Networks]].

The idea is to create hardware (circuits) and software that process information in a way similar to how our [[Brain]]s work, rather than using traditional computer architectures.

- **Neuromorphic Circuits** These are electronic circuits designed to mimic the neural networks in our brains. Key features include:
    - Parallel processing: Many operations happening simultaneously
    - Event-driven computation: Responding to changes rather than clock-based processing
    - Low power consumption: Aiming for the energy efficiency of biological brains
    - Adaptability: Ability to learn and change connections, similar to synaptic plasticity
- **Key Components**
    - Artificial neurons: Circuit elements that mimic biological neurons
    - Synapses: Connections between these artificial neurons, often implemented using memristors or other novel electronic devices
- **Advantages**
    - Potentially much more energy-efficient than traditional computing
    - Better at handling certain types of problems, especially pattern recognition and sensory processing
    - Could lead to more robust and adaptable AI systems
- **Challenges**
    - Designing hardware that truly mimics biological neural networks is complex
    - Scaling up to the size of a human brain (86 billion neurons) is a massive undertaking
    - Programming these systems requires new paradigms different from traditional software development
- **Applications**
    - AI and machine learning
    - Robotics and autonomous systems
    - Brain-computer interfaces
    - Sensory processing (e.g., advanced image and speech recognition)
- **Examples**
    - IBM's TrueNorth chip
    - Intel's Loihi neuromorphic research chip
    - BrainScaleS project in Europe
- **Future Potential** Neuromorphic computing could lead to AI systems that are more energy-efficient, better at learning, and potentially capable of forms of cognition closer to human-like intelligence.

##### Registers:
- small storage areas in your processor
- used to store memory addresses, values or anything 8 bytes or less

#### The [[Stack]]:
- push and pop stack, remember back to maths, a stack is called a 'stack frame'
- first in first out model
- uses pointer movement to add or subtract from the stack

#### [[Assembly]] instructions format:
- each instruction has an operation and either one or two arguments
- assembly has various operations (ops) that do different things, reference a fucking sheet man there are too many to try to remember
- they all execute the op on the registers mentioned above
- every instruction has an address, the area in memory where it is stored

#### Getting into it, an actual program:
- the eip is the instruction pointer, it runs through the program and points to wherever the instruction it reads' address is, executes, then moves to the next instruction

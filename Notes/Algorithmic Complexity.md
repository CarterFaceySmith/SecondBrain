## The Basics

[[Algorithms]] gotta be efficient chief, otherwise they're fuckin worthless most of the time.

How do you figure it out?

*A Priori Analysis*: Fancy words for analysing without factoring in outside factors like the system differences one different machines that run it.

*A Posterior Analysis*: Fuck I hate latin, this is the best way to analyse, you collect running time and space data as the algorithm runs to get a better view at it's complexity.

Suppose **X** is an algorithm and **n** is the size of input data, the time and space used by the algorithm X are the two main factors, which decide the efficiency of X.

-   **Time Factor** − Time is measured by counting the number of key operations such as comparisons in the sorting algorithm.
-   **Space Factor** − Space is measured by counting the maximum memory space required by the algorithm.

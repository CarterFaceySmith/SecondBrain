### Major Divisions:

1. **[[Cerebrum]]**:
    - Largest part of the brain
    - Divided into two hemispheres
    - Outer layer: Cerebral cortex
    - Key functions: Higher-order cognition, sensory processing, motor control
2. **[[Cerebellum]]**:
    - Located at the base of the brain
    - Key functions: Motor coordination, balance, fine motor control, some cognitive functions
3. **[[Brainstem]]**:
    - Connects cerebrum to spinal cord
    - Includes midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata
    - Key functions: Vital functions (breathing, heart rate), relay of sensory and motor information

### Cerebral Cortex Lobes:

1. **Frontal Lobe**:
    - Executive functions, planning, personality, motor control
2. **Parietal Lobe**:
    - Sensory integration, spatial awareness
3. **Temporal Lobe**:
    - Auditory processing, memory, emotion
4. **Occipital Lobe**:
    - Visual processing

### Subcortical Structures:

1. **Basal Ganglia**:
    - Motor control, learning, executive functions
2. **Thalamus**:
    - Sensory and motor relay station
3. **Hypothalamus**:
    - Homeostasis, hormone regulation
4. **Hippocampus**:
    - Memory formation, spatial navigation
5. **Amygdala**:
    - Emotion processing, fear conditioning
6. **Corpus Callosum**:
    - Connects left and right hemispheres

**Computing Analogy**: The brain's organisation can somewhat be compared to a complex computer network:

- Cerebrum: The main server farm, handling high-level processing
- Cerebral cortex: The user interface and application layer
- Cerebellum: The graphics processing unit (GPU) and motion co-processor
- Brainstem: The motherboard and BIOS, managing core system functions
- Frontal lobe: The task manager and system preferences
- Parietal lobe: The touch screen interface
- Temporal lobe: The sound card and some aspects of the file system
- Occipital lobe: The display driver
- Basal ganglia: The keyboard and mouse drivers, handling input and learned sequences
- Thalamus: The main system bus, routing data between components
- Hypothalamus: The cooling system and power management unit
- Hippocampus: The hard drive, storing and retrieving memories
- Amygdala: The firewall and threat detection system
- Corpus callosum: The network switch connecting two main processing units

## The Core Components of EEG Recording

Every EEG recording system, regardless of its complexity, begins with three essential elements:

The ground electrode connects to the amplifier ground (which is isolated from the power supply ground) and typically sits on the scalp, nose, or neck. It acts as a reference point that helps the amplifier maintain stability and reject common-mode interference - those unwanted signals that affect all electrodes equally.

The recording electrodes work in pairs to measure potential differences across the scalp. These differences reflect brain activity patterns generated by neural current sources within the brain. Interestingly, environmental electric and magnetic fields can also create scalp potentials through capacitive coupling, which is why proper grounding and differential amplification are so crucial.

## Understanding Signal Processing

The system uses differential amplifiers, which perform a clever trick: they amplify the difference between electrode pairs while rejecting common-mode potentials (those unwanted signals that appear equally at both electrodes). The amplifier output is proportional to the potential difference between scalp locations, giving us a clear window into brain activity.

## Electrode Technology and Implementation

### Traditional Wet Electrodes
Modern amplifiers have made wet electrode systems more forgiving than ever before. While traditional guidelines called for impedances below 10 kΩ, today's high-input impedance amplifiers (around 200 MΩ) can work effectively with impedances of 30-50 kΩ. This development has enabled two main types of wet electrodes:

1. Conductive Gel Electrodes:
   - Traditional but highly reliable
   - Require scalp abrasion and conductive gel
   - Provide stable, long-duration recordings
   - Take longer to apply (20+ minutes for a full set)

2. Sponge-Saline Electrodes:
   - Faster to apply (15 minutes for 128 electrodes)
   - Use saline-soaked sponges
   - Limited recording time (about one hour)
   - Higher impedance but still effective with modern amplifiers

### Electrode Materials
The choice of electrode material significantly impacts recording quality:
- Silver/silver-chloride (Ag/AgCl): The industry standard, particularly good for event-related potential recordings
- Gold (Au): Minimises drift and reduces high-frequency noise
- Tin (Sn): Economical but introduces noise below 1 Hz
- Platinum (Pt): High-quality option

### The Promise of Dry Electrodes

Recent years have seen increasing interest in dry electrode technology, which could eliminate the need for gels or saline solutions. These electrodes typically work through capacitive coupling with the skin. While several commercial options exist, challenges remain with movement artefacts, environmental noise, and sensor degradation from sweat. Think of it as the difference between traditional wired headphones and wireless earbuds - the convenience is appealing, but the technology is still evolving.

## Electrode Placement and Recording Strategy

### The Bipolarity of EEG
A crucial concept in EEG recording is that all measurements are inherently bipolar - there's no such thing as a true "monopolar" recording. Every measurement requires a pair of electrodes, as the recording depends on current flowing through a measuring circuit. Both electrodes are active, with voltages that fluctuate over time.

### Montage Systems
The placement of electrodes follows standardised systems:
- 10-20 System: The foundation, with 21 electrodes
- 10-10 System: Expands to 74 electrodes
- 10-5 System: Provides comprehensive coverage with up to 142 electrodes

Electrodes are named systematically:
- Odd numbers for left side placement
- Even numbers for right side placement
- 'z' designation for midline electrodes

## Sampling and Signal Quality

To capture brain activity accurately, careful attention must be paid to sampling rates and signal quality:

### Sampling Rate Principles
The system must sample at least twice the highest frequency of interest (the [[Nyquist Criterion]]). In practice, engineers often use a more conservative approach:
- For signals up to 30 Hz, sampling at minimum 75 Hz
- Typical rates range from 200-1000 samples per second
- Anti-aliasing filters prevent misrepresentation of high-frequency signals

## Reference Electrode Selection

*The choice of a reference electrode site*.

>"*No matter which reference strategy is used, we record the potential at one head location with respect to some other head location. By definition this potential difference is the result of integration of the electric field over any path connecting the reference point and the point in question. The potential is not a unique characteristic of a single point but rather a characteristic of the path between two points. 
>The changes in the recorded potentials that result from changing the reference location make intuitive sense since any change involves subtracting the potential at one location on the head from all the other potentials. This has an impact not only on the estimated spatial properties of the EEG but also on its temporal properties, since the potential at the reference location can be expected to vary over time. This impact is evident in figure 6.5, where the time course of the VEP depends on the position of the reference electrode. 
>The main point is that any specific reference, including the mathematically linked-ears or linked-mastoids reference, contributes potentials from distant sites to the potential obtained from each so-called recording electrode. The specific effects of any choice of reference will depend on the configuration of the EEG sources. An average reference based on many electrodes spread widely over the head provides a good estimate of reference independent potentials because it integrates many possible paths to the point.*" - Wolpaw

Reference selection is critical. 

An ideal, completely inactive reference site is not obtainable. Nevertheless, with many electrodes (128 or more) distributed widely over the scalp and the average reference (AVE) method (also called the common average reference (CAR)), it is possible to closely approximate reference-independent EEG recording. 

However, although this approach may be ideal for research or clinical purposes, it is impractical for BCIs intended for long-term use in daily life.

In such situations a very small number of electrodes (e.g., five), portability, ease of use, and capacity for rapid online processing are highly desirable or even essential. 

Thus, because the EEG recording in practical BCI systems is necessarily bipolar, it is probably best to incorporate a variety of promising bipolar strategies into BCI research. 

In this regard, high-resolution EEG methods such as the surface Laplacian have potential advantages, especially when a specific cortical area (e.g., motor cortex) produces the signals used by the BCI.

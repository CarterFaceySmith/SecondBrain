Takes images of the density of [[Neuron]]s *and* the activity of those neurons non-invasively. It is currently the best spatial resolution available for measuring the neuronal activity of the [[Brain]] non-invasively.

Works by BOLD (blood oxygenation level dependent) signals:
- If a bunch of neurons fire a lot they need more blood, this more than compensates for the oxygen use, meaning active parts of the brain have *more* deoxygenated haemoglobin than non-active parts, which exhibits different magnetic properties to oxygenated [[Haemoglobin]].

Because it is based on blood flow, it is very very indirect, but you actually get a weirdly good signal out the other end.

Limited in spatial resolution down to about a millimetre. Temporal resolution is terrible since blood flows slowly.

Cannot measure absolute amounts of activity/[[Metabolism]], only the *difference* between two conditions.

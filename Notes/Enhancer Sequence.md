A regulatory sequence of [[DNA]] which amplifies the [[Gene Expression]] of whatever associated gene it has after being bound by proteins (transcription factors, activators, etc.).

Difficult to identify, some are marked by a distinct [[Epigenetic Profile]], they are non-promoter regions of the genome which are accessible and tagged by specific modifications. E.g. [[DNA Methylation]]

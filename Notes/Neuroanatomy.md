## The Four Major Parts of the [[Brain]]

1. [[Brain Stem]] & [[Cerebellum]]
2. [[Limbic System]]
3. [[White Matter]]
4. [[Cerebral Cortex (Outer Brain Sheet)]]

## Subcortical Bits

- [[Thalamus]]
- [[Hippocampus]]
- [[Amygdala]]

## But what actually *is* a cortical area?

A **distinct** region of the cortex from its neighbours in:
- function
- connectivity to other areas
- distinctive layer structure/cell types (most of the time)

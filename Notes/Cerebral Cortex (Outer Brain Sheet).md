Divided into regions like the visual, auditory and somatosensory cortexes which all get direct input from the [[Lateral Geniculate Nucleus (LGM)]].

Organised via maps!

Generally considered the area of greatest interest in [[Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)]] research because it is most accessible to electrode probes and scalp recording.

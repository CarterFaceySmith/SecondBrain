Delegates are specialised classes to store references to methods (hence, they are reference types).

As long as input-types and output-type are valid, they are placeholders for any functions matching their signature.

While creating the delegate instance, we need to pass the method as a parameter to the delegate constructor.

Multicast - Delegates contain more than one reference, thus executing a series of methods when being called.

Type-safe.

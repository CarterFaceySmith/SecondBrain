### Key Features:

1. **Structure**:
    - Cylindrical projection from the cell body (soma)
    - Can be very long (up to a metre in humans!)
    - Uniform diameter for most of its length
    - Ends in axon terminals (synaptic boutons)
2. **Axon Initial Segment (AIS)**:
    - First part of the axon
    - Site of action potential initiation
    - High concentration of voltage-gated Na+ channels
3. **Myelin Sheath**:
    - Insulating layer formed by glial cells (oligodendrocytes in CNS, Schwann cells in PNS)
    - Increases speed of signal transmission
    - Forms segments along the axon, with gaps called nodes of Ranvier
4. **Saltatory Conduction**:
    - Action potential "jumps" between nodes of Ranvier
    - Significantly increases conduction velocity
5. **Axonal Transport**:
    - Anterograde: moves materials from cell body to axon terminals
    - Retrograde: moves materials from terminals back to cell body
    - Uses molecular motors like kinesin and dynein

**Computing Analogy**: The axon is like a complex network cable system:

- The axon itself is the cable, carrying signals over long distances.
- The myelin sheath is like the insulation on the cable, reducing signal loss and increasing transmission speed.
- Nodes of Ranvier are like signal boosters along the cable, refreshing the signal as it travels.
- Saltatory conduction is like packet switching in networks, where data "jumps" between nodes rather than travelling continuously.
- Axonal transport is like the network's quality of service (QoS) system, prioritising and directing different types of data (cellular materials) along the network.

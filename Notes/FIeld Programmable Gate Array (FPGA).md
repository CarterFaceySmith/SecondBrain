An FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) is an array of logic gates used to implement hardware specific functions, they are specialised functionality units programmed in [[VHDL]].

When you want to specialise in something intensive normally an FPGA is used, e.g. gene sequencing, machine learning, etc. (See Nallatch accelerator card for example).

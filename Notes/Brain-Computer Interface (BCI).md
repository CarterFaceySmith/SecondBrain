## What is a Brain-Computer Interface?

>"*A brainâ€“computer interface (BCI) provides the CNS with new output that is neither neuromuscular nor hormonal. A BCI is a system that measures CNS activity and converts it into artificial output that replaces, restores, enhances, supplements, or improves natural CNS output and thereby changes the ongoing interactions between the CNS and its external or internal environment.*" - Wolpaw

Basically, a BCI records these physiological signals and extracts specific features from them, converting these into artificial outputs that act on the outside world or body itself.

A BCI can:
- *Enhance* natural CNS output
- *Replace* lost natural outputs
- *Restore* lost natural output
- *Supplement* natural CNS output
- *Improve* natural CNS output

## Fundamental Principles of BCI Development

- BCIs create new [[Central Nervous System (CNS)]] outputs that are fundamentally different from natural outputs
- BCI operation depends on the interaction of two adaptive controllers (CNS and the BCI)
- Choosing the appropriate signal type and brain area is difficult and crucial (e.g. recording [[Action Potential]]s from one or many [[Neuron]]s)
	- Cannot be done a priori, must be determined by experimentation with a user
- Recognising and avoiding noise (artefacts) in the signal is also crucial
	- Normally topographical and frequency analyses are used to distinguish [[Brain]] and non-brain signals, with even more precautions used for non-invasive metabolic BCI.
- BCIs can produce output commands that select a goal *or* control a process, i.e. communicate an intent to an external system for actioning or control the actioning itself
- The principal goal of BCI development is the production of systems that are useful for people with severe disabilities who are the principal reason for the existence or instantiation of the field - make systems that are clinically useful.

## Comparing Goal Selection to Process Control

Goal selection protocol places the burden on the application, the BCI communicates the goal and the user simply views and benefits from the result.

Process control protocol places the burden jointly on the user and BCI to produce a series of commands that action a combined intent, the application converts these commands into machine actions and simply does what it is told to do.

Basically, in goal selection the BCI tells the application *what* to do, in process control it tells it *how to do it*.

>"*The most effective and desirable BCIs are likely to be those that imitate to the greatest extent possible the action-appropriate distribution of control that characterizes natural CNS function.*" - Wolpaw 

## Comparing the Action Process of a BCI CNS to a Natural CNS

>"*For example, a BCI asks the cerebellum (which normally helps to ensure that motoneurons activate muscles so that movement is smooth, rapid, and accurate) to change its role to that of helping to ensure that the set of cortical neurons recorded by a microelectrode array produces patterns of action potentials that move a cursor (or a prosthetic limb) smoothly, rapidly, and accurately. The degrees to which the cerebellum and other key areas can adapt to this new purpose remain uncertain. 
>The ultimate capacities and practical usefulness of BCIs depend in large measure on the answers to this question.*" - Wolpaw

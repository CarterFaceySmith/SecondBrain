A [[Statistics]] concept.

A functional relationship between two quantities where some change in one results in a relative change in the other proportional to a power of the change, i.e. *one quantity varies as a power of another*.

Example: If the length of a side of a square is doubled, the area of that square multiplies by a factor of four. A multiplicative rate of change.

Modelled as $y=k*x^a$

Here, $y$ and $x$ are the quantities of interest, $k$ is a constant, and $a$ is the exponent that determines the nature of the relationship.

## Why Do We Care?

>The distributions of a wide variety of physical, biological, and human-made phenomena approximately follow a power law over a wide range of magnitudes: these include the sizes of craters on the moon and of solar flares, cloud sizes, the foraging pattern of various species... the frequencies of words in most languages, frequencies of family names, the species richness in clades of organisms, the sizes of power outages, volcanic eruptions, human judgments of stimulus intensity and many other quantities.

>Empirical distributions can only fit a power law for a limited range of values, because a pure power law would allow for arbitrarily large or small values. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law)

## A Core Property: [[Scale Invariance]]

## Further Notes

- **Heavy Tails**: Power law distributions often have "heavy tails," indicating that extreme events (like earthquakes, internet traffic spikes, or wealth distribution) are more likely than one would expect in a normal distribution. This property can have significant implications in fields like finance, sociology, and network theory.

- **Self-Organisation**: Many systems that follow power law distributions exhibit self-organising behaviour, where local interactions lead to global patterns. This characteristic can be seen in everything from the distribution of city sizes to the connectivity of the internet.

### Key Concepts:

1. **Ion Concentration Gradients**:
    - Inside the neuron: High K+ (potassium), low Na+ (sodium)
    - Outside the neuron: Low K+, high Na+
    - These gradients are maintained by the sodium-potassium pump (Na+/K+-ATPase)
2. **Resting Membrane Potential**:
    - Typically around -70 mV
    - Primarily due to K+ leak channels and the K+ concentration gradient
    - Negative inside relative to outside
3. **[[Nernst Equation]]**:
    - Calculates the equilibrium potential for a specific ion
    - E = (RT/zF) * ln([ion]outside / [ion]inside)
    - R: gas constant, T: temperature, z: ion charge, F: Faraday constant
4. **[[Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) Equation]]**:
    - Calculates the resting membrane potential considering multiple ion species
    - Takes into account ion concentrations and membrane permeabilities
5. **[[Action Potential]]**:
    - Rapid, temporary reversal of membrane potential
    - Phases: depolarisation, repolarisation, hyperpolarisation
    - All-or-nothing response

**Computing Analogy**: Imagine the neuron as a sophisticated battery management system in a laptop:

- Ion gradients are like charge separation in a battery.
- The sodium-potassium pump is the charging circuitry, constantly working to maintain the charge separation.
- Resting potential is like the battery in standby mode, ready but not actively powering intensive processes.
- An action potential is like running a resource-intensive program that briefly drains the battery before it quickly recharges.
- The Nernst and GHK equations are like the algorithms the system uses to calculate and predict battery life based on current usage and charge state.

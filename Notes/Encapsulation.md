One of the tenets of [[Object-Oriented Programming]].

Parameters of functions are modeled as an actual part of the object, ie the functions are in the object, a part of them, therefore minimising parameters and making maintenance of functions easier.

I.e. creates a boundary around an object to seperate the external (public) behaviour from its internal (private) implementation details.

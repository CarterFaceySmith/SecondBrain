A preference relation is a relation of the form 'x is at least as good as y', i.e. $x\succeq y$.

They are used to make decisions over a set of alternatives, by [[Rational Agents]].

You can then take this preference relation and break it down into its [[Symmetry]] and asymmetry:

Asymmetric part:
$$x>y \iff (x \succeq y) \land \neg(y\succeq x)$$
Symmetric part:
$$x\sim y\iff (x\succeq y) \land (y\succeq x)$$

## Rational Preference Relations

A **preference relation** is deemed rational is it exhibits:
1. [[Completeness]]
2. [[Transitivity]]

An **agent** is called rational is it chooses the most desirable among all feasible alternatives.

### Why the fuck is transitivity important here?

So that for every *finite* non-empty set of alternatives, there is a most desirable alternative, i.e. an alternative $x$ so there is no $y$ with $y\succ x$ ('y is more desirable than x').

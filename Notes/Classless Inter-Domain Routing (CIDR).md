A common method to describe [[Networking]] is Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR). The CIDR address is expressed as follows:
- An [[IP Address]] (which is the first address of the network)
- Next, a slash character (/)
- Finally, a number that tells you how many bits of the routing prefix must be fixed or allocated for the network identifier

The bits that are not fixed are allowed to change. CIDR is a way to express a group of IP addresses that are consecutive to each other.

E.g. 192.0.2.0/24

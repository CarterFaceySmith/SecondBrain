## What is Static Analysis?

Static analysis is a method of analysing code without executing it. It scans through your source code files, looking for patterns, structures, and potential issues that could cause problems later on. 

## How Does It Work?

When you run a static analysis tool on your C++ code, it checks for:
- **Syntax Errors:** Simple things like missing semicolons, unmatched parentheses, or typos that can break your code.

- **Potential Bugs:** It identifies code constructs that could lead to runtime errors, such as uninitialised variables or unused function parameters.

- **Code Style and Standards:** It enforces coding conventions and style guidelines you or your team have agreed upon, ensuring consistency and readability.

- **Performance Issues:** It flags inefficient code patterns that could slow down your application, like unnecessary loops or memory leaks.

- **Security Vulnerabilities:** It highlights code that might be susceptible to attacks, such as buffer overflows or unsafe type conversions.

## What is gperftools?

Google Performance Tools, or gperftools, is a collection of performance analysis tools developed by Google. It includes a high-performance multi-threaded [[C++ malloc]] implementation, a [[Threads]]-friendly [[Heap]]-checker, a heap-profiler, and a [[CPU]] [[Profiler]].

## How gperftools Works

1. **Instrumentation**: The profiler uses sampling to collect data about your program's execution.
2. **Low Overhead**: It's designed to have minimal impact on your program's performance.
3. **Data Collection**: Profiling data is written to a file (usually `prof.out`).
4. **Analysis**: The `pprof` tool is used to analyze and visualize the collected data.

## Setting Up gperftools

1. Install gperftools:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install google-perftools libgoogle-perftools-dev  # On Ubuntu/Debian
   ```

2. Link your program against the profiler library:
   ```bash
   g++ -o myprogram myprogram.cpp -lprofiler
   ```

3. Run your program with profiling enabled:
   ```bash
   CPUPROFILE=prof.out ./myprogram
   ```

4. Analyse the results:
   ```bash
   pprof --text ./myprogram prof.out
   ```

## Understanding gperftools Output

The `pprof` tool can generate various types of output. Here's an example of text output:

```
Total: 42 samples
       6  14.3%  14.3%        6  14.3% std::vector<int, std::allocator<int> >::_M_insert_aux
       4   9.5%  23.8%        4   9.5% std::vector<int, std::allocator<int> >::push_back
       3   7.1%  31.0%        3   7.1% __memmove_ssse3_back
       3   7.1%  38.1%        3   7.1% std::vector<int, std::allocator<int> >::size
       2   4.8%  42.9%        2   4.8% std::vector<int, std::allocator<int> >::begin
       2   4.8%  47.6%        2   4.8% std::vector<int, std::allocator<int> >::end
```

This shows:
- The number of samples for each function
- The percentage of time spent in each function
- Cumulative percentages
- Total samples including called functions

## Practical Example

Let's profile a program that does some intensive vector operations:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <random>
#include <chrono>

std::vector<int> generateLargeVector(size_t size) {
    std::vector<int> vec(size);
    std::random_device rd;
    std::mt19937 gen(rd());
    std::uniform_int_distribution<> dis(1, 1000000);
    for (auto& num : vec) {
        num = dis(gen);
    }
    return vec;
}

void processVector(std::vector<int>& vec) {
    std::sort(vec.begin(), vec.end());
    auto it = std::unique(vec.begin(), vec.end());
    vec.erase(it, vec.end());
    std::reverse(vec.begin(), vec.end());
}

int main() {
    auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
        auto vec = generateLargeVector(1000000);
        processVector(vec);
    }
    auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    std::chrono::duration<double> diff = end - start;
    std::cout << "Time taken: " << diff.count() << " seconds" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

Compile and run with gperftools:
```bash
g++ -O2 -g -o vector_ops vector_ops.cpp -lprofiler
CPUPROFILE=prof.out ./vector_ops
pprof --text ./vector_ops prof.out > analysis.txt
```

In the output, you might notice that a significant amount of time is spent in sorting and \[[Memory]] allocation. This could lead you to optimise by using a more efficient sorting [[Algorithms]] for your data distribution or by preallocating memory to reduce [[Dynamic Memory Allocation]].

## Advanced Features

1. **Heap Profiling**: Profile memory allocations:
   ```bash
   HEAPPROFILE=heap.prof ./myprogram
   pprof --text ./myprogram heap.prof > heap_analysis.txt
   ```

2. **Continuous Profiling**: Profile long-running applications:
   ```cpp
   #include <gperftools/profiler.h>
   
   ProfilerStart("prof.out");
   // Code to profile
   ProfilerStop();
   ```

3. **Graphical Output**: Generate a callgraph:
   ```bash
   pprof --pdf ./myprogram prof.out > profile.pdf
   ```

## Pros of gperftools

1. **Low Overhead**: Designed to have minimal impact on program performance.
2. **Versatility**: Offers CPU profiling, heap profiling, and heap checking.
3. **Thread-Friendly**: Works well with multi-threaded applications.
4. **Production-Ready**: Can be used to profile live, production systems.

## Cons of gperftools

1. **Setup Complexity**: Requires linking against the profiler library.
2. **Limited Platform Support**: Primarily designed for [[Linux]] and [[macOS]].
3. **Learning Curve**: Understanding and interpreting the output can be challenging for beginners.

## Best Practices

1. **Profile in Release Mode**: Use `-O2` or `-O3` optimisation flags for realistic results.
2. **Use Representative Data**: Ensure your profiling run exercises typical use cases.
3. **Continuous Profiling**: For long-running applications, consider using the API for continuous profiling.
4. **Compare Profiles**: Always profile before and after optimisations to measure impact.

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Custom Memory Allocators

gperftools includes a high-performance memory allocator. You can use it by linking with `-ltcmalloc`:

```bash
g++ -o myprogram myprogram.cpp -ltcmalloc
```

This can significantly improve performance for programs that do frequent memory allocations.

### 2. Heap Checking

Use the heap checker to find memory leaks:

```bash
HEAPCHECK=normal ./myprogram
```

### 3. CPU Profiling with Interval

Control the profiling rate:

```bash
CPUPROFILE_FREQUENCY=1000 CPUPROFILE=prof.out ./myprogram
```

This sets the sampling frequency to 1000 times per second.

### 4. Differential Profiling

Compare two profiles to see what changed:

```bash
pprof --diff_base=old.prof --text ./myprogram new.prof
```

## Practical Example: Optimizing a Hot Function

Let's say our previous profiling showed that `generateLargeVector` was a hot function. We might optimise it like this:

```cpp
std::vector<int> generateLargeVector(size_t size) {
    std::vector<int> vec;
    vec.reserve(size);  // Preallocate memory
    std::random_device rd;
    std::mt19937 gen(rd());
    std::uniform_int_distribution<> dis(1, 1000000);
    vec.resize(size);  // Resize once instead of growing incrementally
    for (auto& num : vec) {
        num = dis(gen);
    }
    return vec;
}
```

After making this change, we would profile again to measure the improvement:

```bash
g++ -O2 -g -o vector_ops_optimized vector_ops.cpp -lprofiler
CPUPROFILE=prof_optimized.out ./vector_ops_optimized
pprof --text ./vector_ops_optimized prof_optimized.out > analysis_optimized.txt
```

Then compare the results:

```bash
pprof --diff_base=prof.out --text ./vector_ops_optimized prof_optimized.out
```

This would show us how our optimisation affected the performance profile.

## Integration with Other Tools

gperftools can be combined with other profiling and analysis tools for even more insights:

1. **Flamegraphs**: Use Brendan Gregg's flamegraph tools to visualise gperftools output:
   ```bash
   pprof --collapsed ./myprogram prof.out | flamegraph.pl > profile_flame.svg
   ```

2. **Valgrind**: Use [[Valgrind]] for more detailed memory analysis alongside gperftools for CPU profiling.

3. **perf**: On Linux, use perf for system-wide profiling and gperftools for application-specific profiling.

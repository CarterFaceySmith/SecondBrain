# Cryptocurrency Tokens

## Definition
Tokens are digital assets created on existing blockchain platforms, typically implementing standardised protocols like [[ERC-20]] (Ethereum) or [[BEP-20]] (Binance Smart Chain).

### Key Characteristics
1. **Secondary Assets**
   - Built on top of existing blockchains
   - Rely on parent blockchain for:
     * Transaction validation
     * Network security
     * Basic functionality

2. **Types of Tokens**

   a) **Utility Tokens**
   - Provide access to specific services or platforms
   - Examples:
     * Basic Attention Token (BAT) for browser advertising
     * [[Chainlink (LINK)]] for oracle services
     * Filecoin (FIL) for decentralised storage

   b) **Security Tokens**
   - Represent ownership in an external asset
   - Examples:
     * Real estate tokens
     * Company shares
     * Tokenized commodities

   c) **Governance Tokens**
   - Grant voting rights in DAOs
   - Examples:
     * [[Uniswap (UNI)]]
     * Aave (AAVE)
     * Compound (COMP)

   d) **Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)**
   - Unique digital assets
   - Often represent digital art, collectibles, or gaming items

### Technical Implementation
1. **Smart Contract Standards**
   - [[ERC-20]]: Standard fungible token on Ethereum
   - ERC-721: Standard for NFTs
   - BEP-20: Binance Smart Chain token standard
   - [[Solana Program Library (SPL)]]: Solana Program Library tokens

2. **Creation Process**
   ```solidity
   // Example ERC-20 Token Contract (simplified)
   contract MyToken is ERC20 {
       constructor(uint256 initialSupply) 
           ERC20("MyToken", "MTK") {
           _mint(msg.sender, initialSupply);
       }
   }
   ```

## Key Differences

### 1. Independence
- **Cryptocurrencies**: Independent blockchains
- **Tokens**: Dependent on host blockchain

### 2. Transaction Fees
- **Cryptocurrencies**: Pay fees in native currency
- **Tokens**: Pay fees in host blockchain's currency (e.g., ETH for ERC-20 tokens)

### 3. Development Complexity
- **Cryptocurrencies**: Requires building entire blockchain
- **Tokens**: Can be created with simple smart contracts

### 4. Use Cases
- **Cryptocurrencies**: General-purpose value transfer and storage
- **Tokens**: Specific applications, services, or assets

## Common Misconceptions

1. **"All digital assets are cryptocurrencies"**
   - Reality: Cryptocurrencies are a subset of digital assets

2. **"Tokens are less valuable than cryptocurrencies"**
   - Reality: Value is determined by utility and market demand, not asset type

3. **"Tokens can become cryptocurrencies"**
   - Reality: Some tokens can migrate to their own blockchain (e.g., Binance Coin BNB)

## Technical Comparison Table

| Feature | Cryptocurrency | Token |
|---------|---------------|--------|
| Blockchain | Native | Hosted |
| Consensus | Built-in | Inherited |
| Smart Contract | Optional | Required |
| Network Fees | Self-denominated | Host chain currency |
| Creation Difficulty | High | Low |
| Independence | Complete | Dependent |

## Risk Considerations

### Cryptocurrencies
- Network security risks
- Protocol-level vulnerabilities
- Market volatility

### Tokens
- Smart contract risks
- Host blockchain dependencies
- Platform-specific risks
- Contract owner risks

## Best Practices for Development

### Creating a Cryptocurrency
1. Design consensus mechanism
2. Implement network security
3. Build node software
4. Create genesis block
5. Launch network

### Creating a Token
1. Choose appropriate standard
2. Audit smart contract code
3. Test on testnet
4. Deploy to mainnet
5. Verify contract code

## Future Implications

1. **Cross-Chain Compatibility**
   - Emergence of wrapped tokens
   - Bridge protocols
   - Cross-chain standardisation

2. **Regulatory Considerations**
   - Securities laws
   - Banking regulations
   - International compliance

3. **Technical Evolution**
   - New token standards
   - Improved interoperability
   - Enhanced security features

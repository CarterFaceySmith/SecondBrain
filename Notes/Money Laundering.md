Not a guide or recommendation, money laundering is illegal and this is merely an intellectual note out of curiosity and habit.

Money laundering is the process of blending illegally obtained monetary gains with legitimately obtained [[Money]] for various purposes, primarily to make it seem legally obtained.

## Step 1: Placement

The process of acquiring a place to blend illegal funds with legitimate takings, typically done through cash businesses as they have little variable costs (historically launderettes, ergo money *laundering*).

This is the most dangerous step.

## Step 2: Layering

The blending of the illegal funds with the legal funds, done incrementally and slowly to avoid being obvious.

The money then gets moved around to muddy the paper trail, commonly using stocks, gold or shell companies in different jurisdictions.

## Step 3: Reintegration

The funds are now more or less "safe" for normal use and are treated as if so, being moved to regular bank accounts or purchasing further assets.

## [[Cryptocurrency]] Laundering

Commonly done via a coin mixer, a service that mixes a bunch of people's cryptocurrency together (illegal or not) and redistributes the funds clean, although these services are also commonly under surveillance.

Another route is via a peel chain, where a small portion of the crypto is peeled from the person's address in a low-value transfer, these are then sent to an exchange and the remaining coins/tokens are transferred to a new address to repeat the process.

Further, chain hopping is a method of siphoning funds through lots of exchanges using accounts created with stolen identities, the coins are then converted to privacy focused coins like [[Monero (XMR)]] and moved around a bunch to obfuscate the traceability of the crypto.

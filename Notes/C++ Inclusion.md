In [[C++]] programming, inclusion refers to incorporating external libraries, header files, or other code files into your program. This process allows developers to access pre-built functions, [[C++ Classes]], and variable declarations that can be used in their own code. 

There are two types of inclusion in C++:
- Header Inclusion
- Source Inclusion

### Header Inclusion

Header inclusion involves including header files using the preprocessor directive `#include`. Header files are typically used to provide [[Functions]] prototypes, class declarations, and constant definitions that can be shared across multiple source files. There are two ways to include header files in your program:

- Angle brackets `<>`: Used for including standard library headers, like `iostream`, `vector`, or `algorithm`.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
```

- Double quotes `""`: Used for including user-defined headers or headers provided by third-party libraries.

```cpp
#include "myHeader.h"
#include "thirdPartyLibrary.h"
```

### Source Inclusion

Source inclusion refers to including the content of a source file directly in another source file. This approach is generally not recommended as it can lead to multiple definitions and increased [[Compilation]] times but it can occasionally be useful for certain tasks (e.g., [[C++ Templates]] or simple small programs). To include a source file, you can use the `#include` directive with double quotes, just like with header files:

```cpp
#include "mySourceFile.cpp"
```

*Remember, using source inclusion for large projects or in situations where itâ€™s not necessary can lead to unexpected issues and should be avoided.*

React Native is an open-source framework, allows developers to build mobile applications using [[JavaScript]] and [[React]]. 

It enables building apps for both [[iOS]] and [[Android]] platforms by offering a shared codebase, which significantly reduces development time and effort.

Also has hot reloading, which is bloody nice.

With React Native, you write components with JSX, a syntax that combines JavaScript and [[XML]]. These components can map to native [[User Interface (UI)]] elements like views, text, images, and more.

# Scrum

An [[Agile Programming]] methodology.

Initial phase is an outline planning phase, general objectives are established and software architecture is designed.

A series of sprint cycles occurs where each cycle develops the system incrementally.

The project closure phase wraps everything up and completes documentation.

Automatic variable type deduction at [[Compilation]] time.

E.g. `auto x = "Carter"`

An interesting use case is the changing of function return types, by setting the declared assignment variable to `auto` we can automatically handle the changed return via type inference, as long as the code using that variable still works.

*Be careful with this*. Further, being able to know the type of something by reading the code is also important and often less error-prone.

Better used with iterators: `for(auto it = strings.begin(); it != strings.end(); it++)`, if you can't use a `foreach` or range-based loop, i.e. in older C++ versions.

Note: It is important to remember to use `const auto &<your variable>` ([[Pass-by-reference]]) to avoid copying the entire variable you are attempting to assign or whatever, if you have a massive vector this is crucial.

Keep in mind that `auto` deduces the type based on the initialising expression, so if you donâ€™t provide an initial value, you will get a [[Compilation]] error:

```cpp
auto myVar; // Error: Cannot deduce the type without initialiser
```

In [[C++14]], you can also use `auto` with [[Functions]] return types to let the [[Compiler]] automatically deduce the return type based on the returned expression:

```cpp
auto add(int x, int y) {
    return x + y; // The compiler deduces the return type as 'int'
}
```

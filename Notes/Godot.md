Godot is an opensource [[Game Engine]] that is free to use for both personal and commercial purposes, it uses its own scripting language called [[GDScript]] which is syntactically similar to [[Python]].

Godot uses a concept called *nodes*, which can represent entities, sounds, sprites, etc. which are combined into *scenes* to create the game loop which is bound together by your program logic. 

Scenes make up a so-called scene tree, with one root scene and multiple child scenes.

### Abstract

This paper presents a mixed-signal hardware implementation of a biologically realistic [[Spiking Neural Network (SNN)]] for always-on monitoring with online [[Seizure]] detection. The system was validated using wideband [[Electroencephalography (EEG)]]signal recordings with over 122 continuous hours of data, without pre-filtering. 

The network was tested with a cohort of 5 patients and a total of 22 seizures including generalised and focal onsets. The system effectively captures spatiotemporal features based on synchronised multichannel intracranial EEG activity, achieving 100% sensitivity across all patients and near zero false alarms. 

Notably, inference across patients required only calibrating the parameters of the network's output layer on a single recorded seizure from the patient.

### Key Points

- Developed a mixed-signal hardware SNN for online seizure detection
- Used adaptive Asynchronous Delta Modulator (ADM) for signal encoding
- Implemented on DYNAP-SE neuromorphic processor
- Tested on long-term iEEG recordings from 5 patients with 22 seizures
- Achieved 100% sensitivity and near-zero false alarm rate
- Required minimal calibration (single seizure) for each patient

### Methodology

- Used SWEC-ETHZ iEEG database for long-term recordings
- Implemented adaptive ADM for signal encoding
- Designed SNN architecture with two layers:
  1. Hidden layer with excitatory and inhibitory neuron ensembles
  2. Output layer with inhibitory cluster and readout neuron
- Configured SNN on DYNAP-SE neuromorphic processor
- Analysed synchronisation using correlation matrices and coincidence index
- Evaluated performance using sensitivity, false alarm rate, and detection delay

### Results

- Achieved 100% sensitivity across all patients
- Near-zero false alarm rate (0.07/hour on average)
- Mean detection delay of 18.8 seconds
- Estimated average power consumption of 12.48 Î¼W
- Demonstrated effective capture of synchronisation features during seizures

### Conclusions

- Demonstrated feasibility of long-term reliable seizure monitoring on a resource-constrained neuromorphic chip
- Addressed challenges of high false alarm rates and power consumption
- Paved the way for closed-loop neuromodulation System-on-Chip (SoC)
- Future work aims to reduce detection delay and develop dedicated ultra-low power ASIC

### Personal Notes

- The use of adaptive ADM for signal encoding is a clever approach to handle long-term recordings with varying signal amplitudes
- The SNN architecture's ability to capture synchronisation features is impressive and biologically plausible
- The low power consumption and high sensitivity make this approach promising for implantable devices
- Further research on reducing detection delay could significantly improve the system's clinical utility

## Synthesis

This paper presents a significant advancement in the field of neuromorphic computing for biosignal processing, specifically in the context of epileptic seizure detection. By leveraging the inherent characteristics of mixed-signal neuromorphic hardware, the researchers have developed a system that addresses two major challenges in long-term seizure monitoring: high false alarm rates and power consumption. 

The use of adaptive encoding and a carefully designed SNN architecture allows for efficient processing of long-term iEEG recordings, achieving perfect sensitivity and near-zero false alarms across multiple patients. 

This approach demonstrates the potential of neuromorphic systems to enable always-on, low-power monitoring solutions that could significantly improve the quality of life for epilepsy patients.

### Abstract

Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a severely disabling condition that leads to various neurological symptoms. A Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) may substitute some lost function; however, there is a lack of BCI research in people with MS. To progress this research area effectively and efficiently, we aimed to evaluate user needs and assess the feasibility and user-centric requirements of a BCI for people with MS. 

We conducted an online survey of 34 people with MS to qualitatively assess user preferences and establish the initial steps of user-centred design. The survey aimed to understand their interest and preferences in BCI and bionic applications. We demonstrated widespread interest for BCI applications in all stages of MS, with a preference for a non-invasive (n = 12) or minimally invasive (n = 15) BCI over carer assistance (n = 6). Qualitative assessment indicated that this preference was not influenced by level of independence. 

Additionally, strong interest was noted in bionic technology for sensory and autonomic functions. Considering the potential to enhance independence and quality of life for people living with MS, the results emphasise the importance of user-centred design for future advancement of BCIs that account for the unique pathological changes associated with MS.

### Key Points

- First study to identify and report user expectations of BCI systems from people with MS
- Conducted an online survey of 34 people with MS to assess user preferences for BCI applications
- Demonstrated widespread interest in BCI applications across all stages of MS
- Preference for non-invasive or minimally invasive BCIs over carer assistance
- Strong interest in bionic technology for sensory and autonomic functions
- Emphasises the importance of user-centred design for BCIs tailored to MS patients

### Methodology

- Online survey of 34 people with MS
- Participants reported symptoms, assistive technology use, and carer requirements
- Presented three BCI applications: communication, wheelchair control, and robotic arm control
- Participants chose the most useful application and ranked BCI design options based on invasiveness
- Participants also considered broader aspects of MS they would like assistance with
- Qualitative analysis of relationships between MS type, desired BCI functionality, and outcomes

### Results

- 25 respondents (73%) had relapsing-remitting MS, 9 (26%) had primary or secondary progressive MS
- Most respondents (68%) were aged 30-49 years
- Fatigue (82%) and sensory symptoms (79%) were the most common symptoms reported
- 47% of respondents sometimes required carer assistance, 12% often required assistance
- Communication (47%) was the most chosen BCI scenario, followed by wheelchair control (38%) and robotic arm control (15%)
- 75%, 77%, and 100% of respondents for communication, wheelchair control, and robotic arm control scenarios, respectively, preferred sub-scalp or scalp EEG
- Strong interest in bionic technologies for temperature regulation and bowel control
- Level of independence did not appear to influence BCI design preferences

### Conclusions

- People with MS at different stages are interested in BCI technology
- Preference for non-invasive or minimally invasive BCIs over carer assistance
- Need for robust signal acquisition and novel training paradigms to address dynamic changes in MS
- Strong interest in bionic technology for therapeutic applications
- Emphasises the importance of user-centred design approach for advancing BCI research in MS

### Personal Notes

- This study fills an important gap in BCI research by focusing on MS patients, a population often overlooked in previous studies
- The preference for non-invasive or minimally invasive BCIs is interesting and challenges assumptions about users' willingness to undergo more invasive procedures for better performance
- The interest in bionic technologies for autonomic functions highlights the need for a broader approach to assistive technologies beyond traditional BCI applications
- The lack of influence of independence level on BCI preferences is surprising and warrants further investigation
- The study's limitations, particularly the potential bias towards more technologically adept participants, should be considered when interpreting results

## Research Questions

- How do the specific symptoms and progression patterns of MS affect the usability and effectiveness of different BCI designs?
- What are the long-term implications of using non-invasive or minimally invasive BCIs for MS patients, considering the progressive nature of the disease?
- How can BCIs be designed to adapt to the dynamic changes in brain activity associated with MS progression and fatigue?
- What are the potential benefits and challenges of integrating BCIs with other bionic technologies for managing autonomic dysfunctions in MS?

## Gaps in the Literature

- Limited research on BCI applications specifically tailored for MS patients
- Lack of long-term studies on the effectiveness and usability of BCIs in MS population
- Insufficient exploration of user preferences and requirements for BCIs among MS patients
- Limited investigation into the integration of BCIs with other bionic technologies for managing MS symptoms

## Synthesis

The development of Brain-Computer Interfaces for people with Multiple Sclerosis represents a promising avenue for enhancing independence and quality of life. This study highlights the importance of adopting a user-centred design approach in BCI research, particularly for populations with complex and progressive neurological conditions like MS. 

The preference for non-invasive or minimally invasive BCIs among MS patients challenges assumptions about user willingness to adopt more invasive technologies for improved performance. 

Furthermore, the strong interest in bionic technologies for managing autonomic functions suggests that future research should consider a more holistic approach to assistive technologies, integrating BCIs with other bionic solutions to address the diverse symptoms of MS.

## Ideas for Future Research

- Conduct longitudinal studies to assess the long-term effectiveness and usability of BCIs in MS patients, considering disease progression and symptom variability
- Investigate adaptive BCI algorithms that can account for the dynamic changes in brain activity associated with MS progression and fatigue
- Explore the integration of BCIs with other bionic technologies for comprehensive management of MS symptoms, including autonomic dysfunctions
- Develop and test BCI training protocols specifically designed for MS patients, considering factors such as cognitive fatigue and variable symptom presentation
- Investigate the potential of BCIs in monitoring disease progression and predicting symptom flare-ups in MS patients

### Abstract

The progress made in recent decades in neuroscience and new technologies have also influenced the educational environment from the perspective of the didactic methods used and the integration of modern methods. Educational neurotechnologies increasingly present in educational systems are also more challenging for both students, teachers, and parents. In the present article we provide an overview of educational neurotechnologies, with an analysis of the benefits and ethical-legal issues raised by their use. We bring to attention the need to train teachers, in the sense of developing specific skills for using neurotechnologies in the classroom, through training courses. Only in this way is it possible to prevent errors and possible unwanted effects. We sustain the need to integrate the use of educational neurotechnologies in an ethical-legal framework for ensuring personal neurobiological data and respecting confidentiality. The methods used are the analysis of the data provided by specialised works, especially recent ones, the extraction of relevant information for the researched topic and then their synthesis for a better understanding of the problems and the identification of possible solutions.

### Key Points

- Progress in neuroscience and technology has influenced educational methods and integration of modern teaching approaches
- Educational neurotechnologies present both opportunities and challenges for students, teachers, and parents
- Brain plasticity and permeability provide the neurobiological basis for using neurotechnologies in education
- Two main categories of educational neurotechnologies:
    - ICT-based tools like gamification
    - Physical devices connected to individuals for neurofeedback/stimulation
- Critical need for proper teacher training and ethical frameworks for implementation

### Methodology

- Analysis of data from specialized works, particularly recent publications
- Extraction of relevant information related to the research topic
- Synthesis of findings to understand problems and identify solutions
- Use of inductive and deductive methods

### Results

The paper identifies several key findings:

- Neurobiological evidence supports use of neurotechnologies in education through brain plasticity and permeability
- Both benefits and risks exist in implementing educational neurotechnologies
- Teacher training is critical but currently insufficient
- Ethical and legal frameworks needed to protect student data and privacy
- Concerns exist around neurostimulation effects on children
- Need for balance between innovation and safeguards

### Conclusions

- Neurotechnologies in education are inevitable and growing
- Focus should be on effective implementation rather than whether to use them
- Need comprehensive ethical-legal framework for safe use
- Teacher training essential for proper implementation
- Caution needed but should not prevent appropriate use
- Multidisciplinary collaboration required between educators and neuroscientists

### Personal Notes

This paper provides an excellent overview of the intersection between neurotechnology, education and ethics. Key challenges seem to be:

- Developing proper teacher training programs
- Creating ethical guidelines that protect students
- Balancing innovation with safety concerns
- Ensuring equitable access while preventing misuse
- Supporting evidence-based implementation

### Quotations

"The problem is not how to give up these technologies in the classroom, but rather how we can use them effectively, to make the most of the new opportunities for children's development in a fully secured ethical and legal framework"

"It is difficult to argue at this point that there is no place for neuroscience in education"

## Literature Review Sections

- Neuroscience foundations and educational applications
- Ethical considerations in educational neurotechnology
- Teacher training and professional development
- Student privacy and data protection
- Implementation challenges and solutions

## Research Questions

- How can teacher training programs be optimised for neurotechnology integration?
- What ethical frameworks best protect student interests?
- How can equitable access be ensured while preventing misuse?
- What are the long-term effects of educational neurotechnology use?
- How can implementation be evidence-based and monitored?

## Gaps in the Literature

- Limited long-term studies on effects of educational neurotechnology
- Insufficient research on optimal teacher training approaches
- Need for more studies on student privacy protection
- Limited investigation of equity issues
- Lack of standardised implementation frameworks

## Synthesis

The paper effectively bridges the fields of neuroscience, education and ethics to provide a comprehensive overview of challenges and opportunities in educational neurotechnology. While highlighting the inevitable growth of these technologies in education, it emphasises the critical need for proper frameworks, training and protections. The authors take a balanced approach, acknowledging both benefits and risks while arguing for careful but progressive implementation.

## Study Overview
A first-in-human early feasibility study demonstrating successful implantation of a novel endovascular [[Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)]] ([[Stentrode]]) in two patients with [[Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)]]. The device enabled participants to control digital devices for everyday tasks through a combination of [[Brain]] signals and eye tracking.

## Key Points

Device characteristics:
- Self-expanding stent-electrode array 
- Implanted in superior sagittal sinus
- 16 sensors positioned circumferentially
- Wireless signal transmission
- Minimally invasive implantation

Clinical outcomes included:
- Control of Windows 10 operating system
- Text messaging and email capabilities
- Online shopping and banking
- Independent daily task completion
- Long-term device stability

Technical achievements:
- Multiple command control
- High accuracy rates (>90%)
- Fast learning curve
- Stable wireless operation
- Home use capability

## Methodology

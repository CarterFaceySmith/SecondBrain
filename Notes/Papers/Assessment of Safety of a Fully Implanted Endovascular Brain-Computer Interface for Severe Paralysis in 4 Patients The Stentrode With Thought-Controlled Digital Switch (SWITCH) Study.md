### Abstract

Importance: Brain-computer interface (BCI) implants have previously required craniotomy to deliver penetrating or surface electrodes to the brain. Whether a minimally invasive endovascular technique to deliver recording electrodes through the jugular vein to superior sagittal sinus is safe and feasible is unknown.

Objective: To assess the safety of an endovascular BCI and feasibility of using the system to control a computer by thought.

Design, Setting, and Participants: The Stentrode With Thought-Controlled Digital Switch (SWITCH) study, a single-center, prospective, first in-human study, evaluated 5 patients with severe bilateral upper-limb paralysis, with a follow-up of 12 months. From a referred sample, 4 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and 1 with primary lateral sclerosis met inclusion criteria and were enrolled in the study. Surgical procedures and follow-up visits were performed at the Royal Melbourne Hospital, Parkville, Australia. Training sessions were performed at patients' homes and at a university clinic.

Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary safety end point was device-related serious adverse events resulting in death or permanent increased disability. Secondary end points were blood vessel occlusion and device migration. Exploratory end points were signal fidelity and stability over 12 months, number of distinct commands created by neuronal activity, and use of system for digital device control.

Results: Of 4 patients included in analyses, all were male, and the mean (SD) age was 61 (17) years. Patients with preserved motor cortex activity and suitable venous anatomy were implanted. Each completed 12-month follow-up with no serious adverse events and no vessel occlusion or device migration. Mean (SD) signal bandwidth was 233 (16) Hz and was stable throughout study in all 4 patients. At least 5 attempted movement types were decoded offline, and each patient successfully controlled a computer with the BCI.

Conclusions and Relevance: Endovascular access to the sensorimotor cortex is an alternative to placing BCI electrodes in or on the dura by open-brain surgery. These final safety and feasibility data from the first in-human SWITCH study indicate that it is possible to record neural signals from a blood vessel. The favourable safety profile could promote wider and more rapid translation of BCI to people with paralysis.

### Key Points

- First in-human study of an endovascular BCI implanted in the superior sagittal sinus
- No serious adverse events, vessel occlusion, or device migration observed over 12-month follow-up
- Stable signal bandwidth throughout the study period
- Patients successfully controlled a computer using the BCI
- Endovascular approach offers a less invasive alternative to traditional BCI implantation methods

### Methodology

- Single-center, prospective, first in-human study
- 5 patients enrolled, 4 implanted (3 with ALS, 1 with primary lateral sclerosis)
- Implantation procedure:
  - Endovascular delivery through jugular vein to superior sagittal sinus
  - Device connected to subcutaneous electronic unit
- 12-month follow-up period
- Assessments:
  - Safety: Adverse events, vessel occlusion, device migration
  - Feasibility: Signal fidelity, stability, number of decodable commands, computer control

### Results

- No serious adverse events related to the device or procedure
- No vessel occlusion or device migration observed
- Mean (SD) signal bandwidth: 233 (16) Hz, stable throughout the study
- At least 5 attempted movement types decoded offline
- All patients successfully controlled a computer using the BCI
- Patients performed tasks such as texting, emailing, online banking, and shopping

### Conclusions

- Endovascular BCI implantation is a viable alternative to traditional open-brain surgery methods
- The approach demonstrated a favourable safety profile over 12 months
- The BCI allowed successful computer control by patients with severe paralysis
- Results suggest potential for wider and more rapid translation of BCI technology to people with paralysis

### Personal Notes

- The endovascular approach is a significant innovation in BCI implantation, potentially reducing surgical risks
- The stability of the signal over 12 months is promising for long-term use of the device
- The ability of patients to perform everyday digital tasks is a meaningful outcome for quality of life
- Further research with larger, more diverse patient populations will be crucial to confirm these findings

  - Safety and efficacy of endovascular techniques in neurological applications

- BCI Technologies for Severe Paralysis

## Research Questions

- How does the long-term performance of endovascular BCIs compare to traditional implants beyond 12 months?
- Can the endovascular BCI approach be adapted for other neurological applications beyond motor control?
- What are the potential effects of long-term implantation on vascular health and brain function?
- How can the BCI system be optimised to improve decoding accuracy and increase the number of controllable commands?

## Gaps in the Literature

- Limited data on long-term (>12 months) safety and efficacy of endovascular BCIs
- Lack of direct comparison between endovascular and traditional BCI implantation methods
- Insufficient information on the potential for this technology in diverse patient populations (e.g., different types of paralysis, ages, genders)
- Limited exploration of more complex BCI applications using this endovascular approach (e.g., speech decoding, multi-limb control)

## Synthesis

The SWITCH study represents a significant advancement in BCI technology by demonstrating the safety and feasibility of an endovascular approach to electrode implantation. This method potentially offers a less invasive alternative to traditional open-brain surgery, which could expand the accessibility of BCI technology to a broader population of patients with severe paralysis. 

The stable signal quality and successful computer control achieved by patients over a 12-month period suggest that this approach may be viable for long-term use. However, the study's small sample size and homogeneous patient group highlight the need for larger, more diverse studies to confirm these promising results and explore the full potential of this technology.

## Ideas for Future Research

- Conduct a larger, multi-center trial with a more diverse patient population to further validate safety and efficacy
- Investigate the potential for using this endovascular BCI approach for more complex applications, such as speech decoding or multi-limb prosthetic control
- Develop and test adaptive decoding algorithms to improve BCI performance and increase the number of controllable commands
- Explore the combination of this endovascular BCI with other assistive technologies to enhance overall function and quality of life for patients with severe paralysis
- Investigate the long-term effects of the implant on vascular health and brain plasticity through extended follow-up studies

### Abstract

This study presents a brain-inspired platform for prototyping real-time event-based spiking neural networks. The system, called DYNAP-SE2 (DYnamic Neuromorphic Asynchronous Processor-ScalablE 2), supports the direct emulation of dynamic and realistic neural processing phenomena. 

It uses analog circuits paired with low latency asynchronous digital circuits for routing and mapping events. The system enables the definition of different network architectures and provides direct event-based interfaces to convert and encode data from event-based and continuous-signal sensors. 

The paper describes the overall system architecture, characterises the mixed signal analog-digital circuits that emulate neural dynamics, demonstrates their features with experimental measurements, and presents a low- and high-level software ecosystem for configuring the system.

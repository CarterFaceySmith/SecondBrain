### Abstract

Over several decades, EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have attracted attention from researchers in neuroscience, neural engineering, and clinical rehabilitation. While BCI performance has improved, widespread usage remains limited. Visual and auditory BCI systems have become popular due to their high communication speeds, minimal user training requirements, and low user variation. However, building robust and practical systems based on physiological and technical knowledge of neural modulation of visual and auditory brain responses remains challenging. The paper reviews the current state and future challenges of visual and auditory BCI systems, introducing a new taxonomy based on multiple access methods used in telecommunication systems.

### Key Points

- Reviews [[Visual BCI (v-BCI)]] and [[Auditory BCI (a-BCI)]] systems
- Introduces taxonomy based on multiple access methods: TDMA, FDMA, CDMA, SDMA
- Discusses challenges in translating technology to real-life applications
- Examines signal processing and classification approaches

### Methodology

- Reviews existing literature on v-BCI and a-BCI systems
- Categorises systems according to multiple access methods
- Analyses brain signal modulation approaches:
  - Exogenous stimuli (visual/auditory)
  - Endogenous mental activities
- Evaluates system performance metrics including:
  - Information transfer rate (ITR)
  - Classification accuracy
  - Signal-to-noise ratio

### Results

- v-BCI systems generally achieve higher performance than a-BCI
- TDMA and FDMA are most commonly used access methods
- CDMA shows highest potential ITR but is rarely implemented
- Hybrid approaches combining multiple methods show promise
- Current challenges include:
  - Nonlinearity in EEG signals
  - Signal nonstationarity
  - Need for improved ITR
  - Implementation challenges for real-life applications

### Conclusions

- Visual and auditory BCIs show promise for practical applications
- Multiple access framework provides useful taxonomy
- Key challenges remain in:
  - Signal processing and classification
  - System robustness
  - User fatigue reduction
  - Mobile system development
- Future development requires multidisciplinary collaboration

### Personal Notes

- The multiple access taxonomy provides novel framework for understanding BCI systems
- Integration of telecommunication concepts could improve BCI development
- Important considerations for fatigue and user experience in practical applications
- Potential applications beyond medical use deserve further exploration

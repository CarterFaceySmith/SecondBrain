### Abstract

This scoping review evaluates studies of brain criticality involving human data for their current and future clinical relevance. To make the results understandable to a more clinical audience, key concepts behind criticality are reviewed first. The paper then discusses human clinical studies in seven domains: [[Anaesthesia]], [[Epilepsy]], [[Neurodegeneration]], [[Neurodevelopment]], [[Cognition]], [[Sleep Medicine]], and [[Psychiatry]]. Open questions and future research areas are also considered.

### Key Points

- [[Brain Criticality Theory]] refers to the hypothesis that neural networks self-organise into a critical state between order and disorder
- Critical systems exhibit optimal information processing and computing properties
- The review focuses on seven clinical domains where criticality concepts are being applied
- Key concepts include phase transitions, long-range temporal correlations, power laws, and avalanche dynamics
- Clinical applications include biomarkers, disease monitoring, and treatment approaches

### Methodology

- Scoping review using PRISMA-ScR methodology
- Database search of PubMed and Web of Science
- Inclusion criteria: English language, full-text available, human data, clinical relevance  
- Excluded: reviews, non-human data, purely theoretical papers
- 78 studies ultimately included and analysed across 7 clinical domains

### Results

The paper reviews findings in each clinical domain:

- Anaesthesia: Potential markers for anaesthesia depth and recovery from coma
- Epilepsy: Applications in seizure prediction, localisation, and characterisation  
- Neurodegeneration: Insights into Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease pathophysiology
- Neurodevelopment: Changes in critical dynamics across lifespan
- Cognition: Role of criticality in learning and attention
- Sleep: Changes in critical dynamics across sleep stages
- Psychiatry: Alterations in depression, schizophrenia, and other disorders

### Conclusions

- Brain criticality concepts offer new insights across multiple clinical domains
- Potential applications in diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment  
- Challenges remain in proving existence of true criticality in the brain
- More research needed to translate findings into clinical practice
- Multidisciplinary collaboration between physicists and clinicians is key

### Personal Notes

This review provides an excellent overview of how criticality concepts are being applied clinically. The organisation by clinical domain makes it very accessible. Key areas for future work seem to be:

- Developing robust biomarkers based on criticality metrics
- Clarifying the relationship between criticality and disease states
- Translating findings into practical clinical tools and interventions
- Addressing methodological challenges in identifying true criticality

### Quotations

"The future of criticality in the clinical arena will depend in large part on the formation of multidisciplinary teams in which physicists, mathematicians, data scientists, and clinicians collaborate to better answer a clinical question through the lens of criticality."

## Literature Review Sections

- Statistical physics and critical phenomena
- Applications of criticality in neuroscience
- Criticality-based analysis methods (e.g. detrended fluctuation analysis)
- Clinical studies in each of the 7 domains covered

## Research Questions

- How can criticality metrics be translated into robust clinical biomarkers?
- What is the relationship between criticality and disease progression?
- How does pharmacological intervention affect critical brain dynamics?
- Can criticality-based interventions like neurofeedback improve clinical outcomes?

## Gaps in the Literature

- Limited longitudinal studies of criticality changes with disease progression
- Lack of large-scale clinical trials using criticality-based metrics
- Insufficient research on criticality in less studied neurological/psychiatric conditions
- Need for standardised methodologies to assess criticality across studies

## Synthesis

This review demonstrates the broad potential of criticality concepts to provide new insights across neurology and psychiatry. The framework offers a unifying perspective on brain dynamics in health and disease. However, significant work remains to translate these findings into clinical practice. Key challenges include proving true criticality exists in the brain, developing standardised assessment methods, and conducting larger clinical studies. Multidisciplinary collaboration will be essential to realise the clinical potential of brain criticality research.

## Ideas for Future Research

- Develop [[Machine Learning]] approaches to identify criticality-based [[Biomarker]]s
- Conduct longitudinal studies tracking criticality changes during disease progression
- Investigate effects of common neurological/psychiatric medications on critical dynamics
- Explore criticality in less-studied conditions like [[Autism]], [[Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)]], and [[Stroke]] recovery
- Design clinical trials using criticality-based interventions like neurofeedback
- Create standardised software toolboxes for assessing brain criticality in clinical data

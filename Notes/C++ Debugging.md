Debuggers are essential tools for any [[C++]] programmer, as they help in detecting, diagnosing, and fixing bugs in the code. 

## Types of Debuggers

There are several debuggers available for use with C++:

- **GDB (GNU Debugger):** This is the most widely used C++ debugger in the Linux environment. It can debug many languages, including C and C++.
   
Example usage:
   
```
    g++ -g main.cpp -o main    # compile the code with debug info
    gdb ./main                 # start gdb session
    b main                     # set a breakpoint at the start of the main function
    run                        # run the program
    next                       # step to the next line
```

- **LLDB:** This is the debugger developed by LLVM. It supports multiple languages and is popular among macOS and iOS developers.

 Example usage:
   
```
    clang++ -g main.cpp -o main # compile the code with debug info
    lldb ./main                 # start lldb session
    breakpoint set --name main  # set a breakpoint at the start of the main function
    run                         # run the program
    next                        # step to the next line
```

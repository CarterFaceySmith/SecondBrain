## Overview

Core aspects:
- Signal quality
- Array yield
- Longevity of recording
- Signal stability
- Overall performance

## Signal Quality Measurements

- Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is the key quality metric
- SNR of 2.5-4.0: Indicates multineuron activity (minimum useful level)
- SNR above 4.0: Indicates single-neuron activity
- Most useful electrode sites record either:
    - Multineuron activity, or
    - One to two distinct single neurons plus multineuron activity

## Array Performance Metrics

### Array Yield

- Defined as the fraction of electrodes that record usable spike activity
- Typical yield ranges from 50-90% in both animal and human studies
- Performance can vary significantly between implants

### Signal Stability

- Measures consistency of recording from the same neurons over time
- Tracked through spike waveforms and timing patterns
- Challenges include:
    - Up to 30% error rate in identifying specific neurons
    - Waveform features can change up to 30% over 24 hours
    - Despite these issues, brain-computer interface control remains robust

### Recording Longevity

- Various electrode types have demonstrated viable recordings over months
- Different microelectrode technologies show comparable performance
- Success rates in experienced laboratories range from 60-90%

## Current State and Future Goals

- Long-term neural recordings are feasible but need improvement
- Key development areas:
    - Increasing the number of viable recording sites
    - Improving signal fidelity
    - Enhancing day-to-day stability
    - Extending longevity from months to decades
    - Improving overall reliability

## Assessing the Local Brain Response

We must also evaluate any localised tissue responses around the implant, e.g. deleterious brain-tissue responses or immune responses.

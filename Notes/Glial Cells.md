### Types and Functions:

1. **Astrocytes**:
    - Star-shaped cells
    - Regulate neurotransmitter uptake and release
    - Maintain ion balance in extracellular space
    - Form the blood-brain barrier with endothelial cells
    - Provide metabolic support to neurons
2. **Oligodendrocytes** (CNS) / **Schwann Cells** (PNS):
    - Form myelin sheaths around axons
    - Increase speed of action potential propagation
    - Provide trophic support to neurons
3. **Microglia**:
    - Immune cells of the CNS
    - Phagocytose cellular debris and pathogens
    - Release inflammatory mediators
    - Prune synapses during development and plasticity
4. **Ependymal Cells**:
    - Line ventricles and central canal of spinal cord
    - Produce and circulate cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
    - Some act as neural stem cells
5. **Radial Glia**:
    - Present during development
    - Guide migrating neurons
    - Serve as progenitor cells for neurons and glia

### Key Functions:

- Homeostasis: Maintain optimal neuronal environment
- Support: Provide physical and metabolic support to neurons
- Protection: Defend against pathogens and injury
- Development: Guide neuronal migration and differentiation
- Plasticity: Contribute to synaptic plasticity and remodeling

**Computing Analogy**: If neurons are the CPUs of the brain, glial cells are everything else in the computer system:

- Astrocytes are like the operating system, managing resources and maintaining the overall environment.
- Oligodendrocytes/Schwann cells are like the insulation on high-speed data cables, optimizing signal transmission.
- Microglia are the antivirus software and system cleanup utility, defending against threats and removing unnecessary files.
- Ependymal cells are like the liquid cooling system, circulating fluid to maintain optimal operating conditions.
- Radial glia are like the installation wizard during system setup, guiding the initial configuration of the system.

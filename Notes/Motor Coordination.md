The process of creating movement is a result of the interaction between several cortical and subcortical [[Brain]] areas that transform an abstract movement goal into a sequence of [[Muscle]] activations to effect that movement.

These goals can be represented in visual coordinates or might be generated internally.

Feedback for the movement is generated by the somatosensory and visual systems, with the [[Cerebellum]] thought to refine the dynamics of the movement through its connections with the [[Cerebral Cortex (Outer Brain Sheet)]]. The [[Basal Ganglia]] is also considered important in optimising actions.

## Planning vs. Execution

Motor behaviour can generally be categorised into these two phases, with planning providing more abstract information about the movement and occurring higher in the motor hierarchy.

Planning:
- Identification of a goal
- Selection of a limb to be used
- Specification of a path to the target

### Key Features:

1. **Structure**:
    - Small, membrane-bound spherical organelles
    - Typically 40-100 nm in diameter
    - Lipid bilayer membrane surrounding an aqueous core
2. **Types**:
    - Synaptic vesicles: Store neurotransmitters
    - Dense-core vesicles: Store neuropeptides and larger molecules
    - Endosomes: Involved in membrane trafficking and recycling
3. **Neurotransmitter Loading**:
    - Active transport of neurotransmitters into vesicles
    - Uses specific vesicular transporters
    - Driven by proton gradient across vesicle membrane
4. **Vesicle Cycle**:
    - Docking: Vesicles attach to the presynaptic membrane
    - Priming: Vesicles prepare for fusion
    - Fusion: Ca2+-triggered release of contents (exocytosis)
    - Endocytosis: Retrieval of vesicle membrane
    - Recycling: Reformation of vesicles for reuse
5. **Regulation**:
    - SNARE proteins: Mediate vesicle fusion
    - Synaptotagmin: Ca2+ sensor for triggered release
    - Rab proteins: Control vesicle trafficking and targeting

**Computing Analogy**: Vesicles are like a sophisticated packet-switching system in computer networks:

- Each vesicle is a data packet, with the membrane as the packet header and the neurotransmitters as the payload.
- Neurotransmitter loading is like data encryption, packaging the information securely.
- The vesicle cycle is similar to the lifecycle of a network packet:
    - Docking is like a packet arriving at a router
    - Priming is like packet verification and routing table lookup
    - Fusion is like packet transmission
    - Endocytosis and recycling are like freeing up network resources for the next transmission
- SNARE proteins and synaptotagmin are like network protocols ensuring proper packet delivery and timing.
- Rab proteins are like network address translation (NAT) tables, ensuring vesicles reach the correct destination.

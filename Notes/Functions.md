Fundamentally, at a low level a function is a contiguous [[Memory]] space of sequential instructions to be called by your program as needed.

## C++ Example
```C++
int sum(int iNumOne, int iNumTwo){
	return iNumOne + iNumTwo;
}
```

The above function takes two arguments in the form of integers which are summed together and returned.

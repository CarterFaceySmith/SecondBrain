A region of the [[Brain]] located just above the [[Brainstem]] and [[Cerebellum]] that most incoming sensory information stops in at en route to the cortex.

#### Example of relaying within:

Within the Thalamus a visual sensory impulse travels along the optical nerves before making a [[Synapse]] within the [[Lateral Geniculate Nucleus (LGM)]] of the Thalamus before being relayed to the optical cortex.

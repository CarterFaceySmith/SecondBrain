# The Central Limit Theorem

It means that regardless of sample distribution, the mean histogram always has [[Normal Distribution]] (normally, but note there are a *veeery* few circumstances where this is violated).

BUT **CARTER**, *WHYYYY* DO I GIVE A SHIT?

Well, this theorem basically allows you to disregard where your original data comes from and it's distribution when doing an experiment, since sample means will be normally distributed anyway.

## What is FDN?

Function Delivery Network (FDN) is an extension of the [[Cloud Computing]] concept, [[FaaS (Function as a Service)]], to support heterogeneous functions and clusters. It's a network of distributed heterogeneous target platforms. 

A target platform is a combination of a cluster of homogeneous [[Node]]s and a FaaS platform on top of it. FDN provides Function-Delivery-as-a-Service (FDaaS), delivering the function to the right target platform.

## Key Features

- **Heterogeneous Support**: Unlike traditional FaaS platforms that are limited to homogeneous clusters and functions, FDN extends support to heterogeneous clusters and functions.

- **Data Access Behaviour**: FDN takes into account the data access behaviour of functions before scheduling, which is not typically done in traditional FaaS platforms.

- **Varied Target Platform's Characteristics**: FDN offers opportunities such as varied target platform's characteristics, possibility of collaborative execution between multiple target platforms, and localisation of data.

- **Service Level Objective (SLO) Requirements and Energy Efficiency**: FDN fulfils two objectives: meeting Service Level Objective (SLO) requirements and achieving energy efficiency when scheduling functions.

## Benefits

- **Energy Efficiency**: Scheduling functions on an edge target platform can significantly reduce the overall energy consumption without violating the SLO requirements.

- **Collaborative Execution**: FDN allows for the possibility of collaborative execution between multiple target platforms.

- **Data Localisation**: FDN offers the advantage of data localisation, which can lead to improved performance and efficiency.

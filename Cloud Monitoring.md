Basically just for making the optimal use of your rented resources so your costs are lower and your users, if you have them, have higher satisfaction.

It's the process of collecting status information on the applications and resources from a monitoring system (consisting of all components for gathering data at runtime).

This information can be generated proactively (E.g. continuous overview of status information), or reactively (E.g. triggered from an event or incident).

The general requirements for a *good* monitoring system are:
- Comprehensive
- Low intrusion
- Extensible
- Scalable
- Elastic
- Accurate
- Resilient

## Three Pillars of Monitoring

### 1. Metrics

The metric (i.e. what you're tracking) and context (i.e. where you're tracking it (server, application service, etc.)).

Also:
- Its representation
- Can have an aggregation element (sum, min, max, etc.)
- The measurement frequency of the metric

E.g. Latency, error rate, utilisation.

### 2. Logs

### 3. Traces

There are unique correlations possible only with [[Qubits]].

Take the three people Alice, Bob and Charlie again, Charlie creates a particular entangled state and sends a qubit to Alice and the other to Bob, who then measure and compare the results.

Charlie sends another prepared identically, this then happens over and over with Alice and Bob cataloguing their findings.

Noticing:
- If z measurements are made on both qubits, they never both output 0
- If an x measurement is made on one qubit and outputs 1, a z measurement on the other will output 0

(This corresponds to the initial shape and colour example noted in [[Quantum Communication]])

But the truth is...

The results of qubits are not well-defined before *measurement*. 

>Though this might seem like it means that qubits are more random that classical variables, it is not always a negative quality. It also means that restrictions applied to classical variables do not always apply to qubits, and that quantum correlations can have properties that would be impossible classically. These unique correlations are one of the signature properties of entangled states.

# Binary Search

A search algorithm with a run-time complexity of O(log n), works by dividing and conquering. The middle most item of a data structure is compared to what is being searched for, if the item is greater or lesser the corresponding half is then searched the same way until an index is returned or the size of the subarray (searchable section) reduces to 0.

The data structure must be sorted for this approach to work.

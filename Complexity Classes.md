# Complexity Classes

A decision problem can fit into two complexity classes based on it's characteristics:

1. P: Can be solved in *polynomial* time or less on deterministic [[Turing Machines]]
2. NP: Can be solved in *polynomial* time of less on non-deterministic [[Turing Machines]]

Note: $$P \subseteq NP$$

An 'agent' generally has sensors to perceive an environment, and actuators to act upon that environment.

A *rational* agent, **selects actions that maximises it's expected utility in the environment**, naturally this involves the agent having a set of preferences over the set of possible choices it can make.

These preference relations are called *rational* if they exhibit both [[Completeness]] and [[Transitivity]].

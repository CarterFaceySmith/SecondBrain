# C++

C++ programs must be compiled before running, compiling creates an exe. If changes are made the file must be recompiled before the next run.

Notes:
- C++ supports some implicit typecasting


#### Typedefs

You can define new types using 'typedef' eg.

	typedef int Integer; //creates a new int type called Integer that can be used in place of int

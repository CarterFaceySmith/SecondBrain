A transition function, commonly used in deterministic finite-state [[Automata]], is a mathematical function that takes state:input pairs and maps each one to a corresponding subsequent state.

The function must be 'total', ie defined for all possible state and input symbol, with one ouput for any particular input, giving the 'deterministic' part of the name its meaning.

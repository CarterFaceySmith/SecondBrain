## Formal Languages

A formal language has:
1. Alphabet = symbols
2. Syntax = orderings of those symbols
3. Possibly semantics = the meaning of those syntax

##### Rigurously defining what constitutes a formal language, because it's fun to suffer and life is pain

A language, L, is a possibly infinite set of strings over a finite alphabet 'sigma'. Eg.
$$
\sum = {a,b}
$$
Sigma* is all possible orderings/strings of those symbols, eg
$$
\sum* = {a, b, ab, ba, aa, bb, aaa...}
$$
So all languages are a subset of Sigma*, making the set of all languages the *power set* of Sigma*.

Here's an example, open wide.  

$$
\begin{align}
L_1 = {a,\; ab,\; aaa,\; aab,\; abb \ldots} \\
L_1 = {w\; |\; w\; begins\; with\; a} 
\end{align}
$$
Above is a language using the aforementioned alphabet, in this language only words beginning with a are allowed.

**Note**: 
	Sometimes when figuring out a language from an [[Automata]] diagram, it is easier to define the complement of the language, ie what the automata *does not accept* than what it does, and write the language as the complement of that.

## Grammars (AKA syntax)

A grammar is a logical system that can be used to prove that a given string 'u' is a member of the language 'L'. 

I.e. a set of rules for creating words from a language.

### Grammar Types

#### Syntax
- Terminals: set of lower case chars from an alphabet $\Sigma$
- Vars: set of upper case characters, used in production of words but do not appear in the words produced
- Start symbol: Special symbol denoting start of the grammar, normalling *S*
- Set of rules (*S*): the rules dictating how words may be created

#### Types
1. Regular Grammar Type
	1. LHS must be single var.
	2. RHS must be single terminal, terminal followed by a var or $\lambda$

2. Context-Free Grammar Type
	1. LHS must be single var.
	2. RHS may be any combo of terminals and vars

3. Context-Sensitive Grammar Type
	1. LHS and RHS may be any non-empty combination of terminals and vars
	2. Length of the LHS must not be *greater* than the length of the RHS

Below is an example from the wiki entry regarding how this is used in practice:

## The Chomsky Hierachy

- Type 0: Generated by unrestricted languages
- Type 1: Context-sensitive languages
- Type 2: Context-free languages
- Type 3: Regular languages

Remember each language of type *i* is a proper subset of the language type *i - 1*.

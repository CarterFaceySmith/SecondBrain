# Queue

A type of abstract data structure, similar to [[Stack]].

Queues are open at both ends, with one end being used to insert and the other being used to remove data.

Queues are 'first-in-first-out', the data item stored first is the first to be accessed.

Can be implemented with [[Arrays]], [[Linked-Lists]] and [[Pointer]]s.

#### Basic Operations
- enqueue(): add item to the queue
- dequeue(): remove an item from the queue
- peek()
- isFull()
- isEmpty()

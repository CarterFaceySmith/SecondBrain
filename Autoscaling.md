a [[Cloud Computing]] concept wherein an application automatically scales to meet service level objectives under a varying workload *whilst* minimising costs.

## Service Level Objectives (SLOs)

- Latency of requests $<$ latency threshold
- Failed request rate $<$ failed request threshold
- Service availability $>$ availability threshold

## Service Level Agreement (SLA)

- Contract specifying the SLOs
- Fines

## Autoscaler Approaches

1. Reactive
2. Scheduled

## What the fuck is FaaS?

So, Function-as-a-Service, or FaaS for short, is a type of [[Cloud Computing]] service that allows you to execute your code in response to events without the complex infrastructure typically associated with building and launching [[Microservices]] applications. Think of it as the lazy developer's dream - you get to focus on your code, and the cloud service takes care of the rest.

## How does it work?

When you're using FaaS, you write your piece of code (which we call a function) and then you throw it over the fence to your cloud provider. Your cloud provider says, "No worries, I've got this!" and runs the code for you. They handle all the messy stuff like server management, capacity planning, and maintenance. Your function is executed when a specific event is triggered, like a user clicking a button on your website, or a new file being uploaded to a server.

## Why should I care?

Here are a few reasons why FaaS is pretty damn cool:

- **No Server Management**: You don't have to worry about any servers, it's all managed by the cloud provider. You just focus on the code.

- **Cost Efficiency**: With FaaS, you only pay for the compute time you consume. If your function isn't running, you're not being charged. Sweet deal, right?

- **Scalability**: FaaS can handle scaling automatically, both up and down. If your app goes viral overnight, the service can handle the load.

- **Faster Release Cycle**: Since you're not dealing with infrastructure, you can get your application to market faster.

## Popular FaaS Providers

There are several big players in the FaaS game:

- **AWS Lambda**: Amazon's FaaS offering. It's deeply integrated with other AWS services, which can be a big plus if you're already in the AWS ecosystem.

- **Google Cloud Functions**: Google's FaaS service. Like AWS Lambda, it plays nice with other Google Cloud services.

- **Microsoft Azure Functions**: Microsoft's take on FaaS. If you're an Azure user, this could be the one for you.

- **IBM Cloud Functions**: Based on Apache OpenWhisk, IBM's FaaS offering might appeal to you if open source is your thing.

Remember, FaaS is a tool, and like any tool, it's not a one-size-fits-all solution. It's great for some use cases, but not for others. 

## Use when?

- Easily decomposable functions  
- Highly-variable demand (fast response time needed)  
- No high frequency in triggering  
- Overhead of running instances is high (people/management cost) 
- Need for tight integration to cloud events

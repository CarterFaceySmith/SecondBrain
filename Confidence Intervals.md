# Confidence Intervals

Confidence Intervals (CI) are an estimated range of vals that seem reasonable, ie that you can be *confident innnn*, centre is still on the mean but either side is extended to encompass uncertainties

Confidence intervals are always: point estimate +- ME (Margin of Error)
	Where ME is calculated as the product of a critical val and SE
	
Note that when following [[The T Distribution]] the formula is: point estimate +-  t* x ME (Margin of Error)
	Where t* is the critical value

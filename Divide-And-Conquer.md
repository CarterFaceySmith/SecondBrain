# Divide-And-Conquer

An approach to algorithms in which the problem is divided into smaller subproblems and then each of these is solved **independently**.

#### Dividing
The problem is broken into the smallest possible atomic subproblems, whilst still representing a part of the overall problem.

#### Conquering
The subproblems are then solved independently.

#### Merging
The smaller subproblems, now solved, are recursively combined until they form the solution for the original problem.
